原文: This is a bird feeder. And everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an eight part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
翻译: 这是一个喂鸟器。而我左侧的所有装置，都是为了防松鼠而设的。如果它们想偷吃鸟食，首先得通过这个堪称松鼠版"忍者勇士"的八重障碍关卡。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "squirrel proof"译为"防松鼠"简洁准确，"attempt at making it"转化为"为...而设的"更符合中文表达习惯  
2. "ninja warrior obstacle course"采用文化意象转换，借用国内观众熟悉的《忍者勇士》综艺节目名称，保留原比喻的趣味性  
3. "eight part"译为"八重"既保留数字信息又符合中文量词用法  
4. 通过"偷吃""堪称"等措辞保留原文幽默调侃的语气）

原文: This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart, but out of the gate. I will admit that in hindsight that I completely underestimated my adversary. Now, if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a bird watcher. And it was just so lovely until they showed up.
翻译: 这门课程极具挑战性，绝非胆小之辈所能胜任。不过坦白说，事后回想起来，我完全低估了这个对手。若你好奇我为何自找麻烦，我们得回溯到八周前——当时我困在家中百无聊赖，便安装了喂鸟器决心当个观鸟者。原本一切如此美好，直到它们出现。

（翻译说明：
1. 保留原文的叙事层次感，通过"回溯到八周前"自然过渡倒叙
2. "not for the timid of heart"译为"绝非胆小之辈所能胜任"，既保留比喻又符合中文四字格表达习惯
3. "adversary"根据上下文译为"对手"，暗示鸟类后来造成的困扰
4. "stuck at home and very bored"处理为"困在家中百无聊赖"，用成语增强文学性
5. 结尾"until they showed up"译为"直到它们出现"，保留悬疑感，为后续冲突埋下伏笔
6. 整体采用口语化书面语体，符合个人回忆录的语体风格）

原文: Now, luckily, my bird feeder had a wire cage around it. Big enough for the birds to slip inside, but small enough to prevent the squirrels from getting the food. And that worked really well until right here. For me, this was like the moment in Jurassic park when they realized the velociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn't their first rodeo. They basically cleared this whole tube of birdseed by the end of the day. Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised as being squirrel proof. So I bought another squirrel proof bird feeder to replace it. It's got this outer cage suspended by some springs. And so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn't weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes, it'll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no idea how the squirrels could possibly outsmart this, but let's see. And this one worked exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it. But when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts down. And now all the seed ports are covered up. Every time they tried, it was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springs that hold the cage up, which means the cage stays in the lowered position where it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now they can get to the lid. But this bird feeder lid doesn't hinge open to give direct access. So he goes with a different tactic where he now has access to all the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try one more bird feeder design.
翻译: 幸运的是，我的喂鸟器外围装有金属网笼。网眼大小刚好能让鸟儿钻入，又能阻止松鼠偷食。这招一直很管用——直到此刻。对我来说，这简直就像《侏罗纪公园》里人们发现迅猛龙会转动门把手的震撼场景。一旦大门敞开，显然这群松鼠早已轻车熟路。到日落时分，它们几乎把整管鸟粮洗劫一空。要知道这个喂鸟器可是打着"防松鼠"的旗号出售的。

于是我换了另一个号称防松鼠的喂鸟器。这个设计利用弹簧悬挂外层网罩——当鸟儿停驻时，体重较轻不会触发机关，仍能啄食；但若有松鼠攀附，其重量会压降弹簧网罩，从而封住投食口。我实在想不出松鼠还能如何破解，且让我们拭目以待。

这个装置起初运行完美：鸟儿们欢快进食，而每当松鼠来袭，网罩便应声落下封住所有食槽。屡次尝试，屡次挫败。然而次日清晨，这只松鼠竟解开了固定网罩的弹簧扣，导致防护罩永久性降下。虽然食槽被封锁，它们却转而盯上了顶盖——这个顶盖本不能直接掀开。但这难不倒它，只见它转换策略，最终将整罐鸟粮尽收囊中。

看来，我得再换第三种喂鸟器设计方案了。

原文: Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one's supposed to work well because it's got this baffle which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight down and getting to the seeds.
翻译: 好的。哇哦。现在感觉这简直是故意的。这个应该很管用，因为它设计了这个挡板，就是为了防止松鼠直接爬下来偷吃种子。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 保留原文的语气词"Okay. Wow."，译为"好的。哇哦。"，自然传达惊讶情绪。  
2. "intentional"译为"故意的"符合口语化场景，"at this point"灵活处理为"现在"  
3. "baffle"译为"挡板"准确体现物理结构特征  
4. "keep the squirrels from..."长句拆分，用"就是为了..."突出设计目的，动词"coming straight down"译为"直接爬下来"更符合中文对动物行为的描述  
5. 整体保持口语化吐槽风格，最后"偷吃种子"比直译"获取种子"更生动）

原文: And more importantly, there's no way for them to Rip this off. We'll see.
翻译: 更重要的是，他们绝对没法抄袭这个。我们走着瞧。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "Rip this off" 译为"抄袭"准确传达了原意，同时"绝对没法"加强了否定语气，匹配原文的自信态度  
2. "We'll see" 译为"走着瞧"既保留口语化特征，又隐含较劲的意味  
3. 整句采用中文常见的四字结构"绝对没法"，符合汉语表达习惯  
4. 感叹号改为句号，因中文较少在陈述句中使用感叹号，同时保留原文挑衅感）

原文: This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes. This is when I really started to gain an appreciation for what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feeder was their favorite. Okay, yeah, they're flexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan was forming in my head. But just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can't say I was surprised when they just climbed it. Nor was I surprised to see they could shimmy up and down a small metal pole, or even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb a certain pole material was a moot point anyways. Because of this. Look at this. These guys are basically freaking rodent sized.
翻译: 这只松鼠初次亮相时表现相似。当它仅用几根脚趾悬吊时，我才真正开始意识到它们的能力。这个喂鸟器显然是它们的最爱。好吧，它们绝对是在向我炫耀。此时，我脑海中已开始酝酿一个计划。但为了彻底验证，我把立柱移到了远离围栏的位置。当看到它们照样攀爬而上时，我丝毫不觉意外。它们能在细金属杆甚至粗杆上灵活攀援的景象，同样在我预料之中。事实上，讨论它们能否攀爬某种材质的立柱已毫无意义——因为眼前这一幕说明了一切。看看，这些家伙简直和啮齿动物一样灵巧。

（翻译说明：译文通过以下手法实现自然流畅的表达：
1. 将"hangs by a few toes"译为形象化的"仅用几根脚趾悬吊"
2. "flexing on me"采用网络流行语"炫耀"传递戏谑语气
3. "moot point"译为成语"毫无意义"保持简洁性
4. "freaking rodent sized"处理为"和啮齿动物一样灵巧"，既保留比喻又符合中文表达习惯
5. 通过"丝毫不觉意外"、"照样"等短语保持原文的递进式观察语气）

原文: Simone Biles. And on some level, this is what it felt like when someone stole a package from my porch that didn't belong to them. And I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the glitter bomb bait package.
翻译: 西蒙·巴尔斯。某种程度上，这就像有人从我门廊偷走不属于他们的包裹时我的感受。我将这种愤慨化为动力，花了一年时间设计出这个闪光炸弹诱饵包裹。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 人名"Simone Biles"采用通用译名"西蒙·巴尔斯"  
2. "indignation"译为"愤慨"准确传递被侵权后的道德愤怒

4. "glitter bomb bait package"译为"闪光炸弹诱饵包裹"保持技术术语准确性，同时通过"诱饵"明确其功能属性  
5. 整体采用口语化短句结构，还原说话者讲述个人经历的语气）

原文: Hello. Complete with special fragrances. If I could design a package to deter thieves, could I design a bird feeder to deter squirrels?
翻译: 你好。内含独特香氛配方。如果我能设计一个防盗包装，那我是不是也能设计一个防松鼠的喂鸟器？

（翻译说明：  
1. 保持原文的问候语"Hello"译为"你好"，简洁自然。  
2. "special fragrances"译为"独特香氛配方"，既准确传达产品特性又符合中文美妆品常见表述。  
3. 后半句采用中文假设句式"如果...那..."，保留原句的思考逻辑链。"deter thieves/squirrels"统一处理为"防盗/防松鼠"，动词"设计"在中文里可重复使用以保持节奏感。  
4. 疑问语气通过"是不是"实现，比直译"could I"更符合中文口语习惯。）

原文: And so, after a couple weeks of brainstorming, designing and building with my buddy John, we put it all together in this 22nd build montage.
翻译: 经过几周的头脑风暴、设计和与我朋友约翰一起的搭建，我们最终在这个第22次搭建集锦中完成了所有工作。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "brainstorming, designing and building" 译为“头脑风暴、设计和搭建”，准确对应原文的三个动作。  
2. "my buddy John" 译为“我朋友约翰”，口语化且自然，符合中文表达习惯。  
3. "22nd build montage" 译为“第22次搭建集锦”，保留序数词和“montage”的短片合集含义。  
4. 整体句式按中文逻辑调整，将时间状语前置，用“最终”衔接结果，保持流畅性。）

原文: Here are the basic elements. For starters, here's where I've placed their favorite bird feeder at the end of the course.
翻译: 以下是基本要素。首先，我在课程终点处放置了他们最喜爱的喂鸟器。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "basic elements" 译为"基本要素"符合中文科技/教学类文本表述习惯  
2. "for starters" 采用"首先"而非字面意义的"给初学者"，因上下文体现的是步骤说明而非新手教学  
3. 将英文被动语态"here's where I've placed"转化为中文主动表述"我...放置"，更符合中文表达逻辑  
4. "favorite bird feeder" 译为"最喜爱的喂鸟器"准确传递原意，保留"favorite"的情感色彩  
5. 调整英文倒装结构为中文顺叙语序，同时保持"at the end of the course"空间位置的准确性）

原文: And to sweeten the deal, right below that there's a trap door.
翻译: 为了让这交易更诱人，正下方就设了个暗门。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "sweeten the deal"译为"让交易更诱人"，保留了口语化表达和原句的利诱语气；

3. 添加"就"字强化了原文隐含的戏剧性揭示效果；  
4. 整体采用短句结构，还原了美式台词干净利落的风格）

原文: And if they step here, it releases a butt ton of walnuts and unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts?
翻译: 如果他们踩到这里，就会触发机关，释放出一大堆核桃并展开庆祝横幅。为什么是核桃呢？

翻译说明：
1. "butt ton" 译为"一大堆"，既保留了口语化的夸张语气，又符合中文表达习惯
2. "unfurl some celebratory banners" 译为"展开庆祝横幅"，准确传达了原意
3. 保留了原文的疑问句式"为什么是核桃呢？"，维持了说话者困惑的语气
4. 整体翻译流畅自然，既忠实于原文内容，又符合中文观众的观看习惯
5. 补充了"触发机关"使动作逻辑更清晰，这是中文表达中常见的增译手法，并未改变原意

原文: I'm glad you asked. I'm using walnuts because over the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven different nuts and seeds.
翻译: 很高兴你问起这个。我选择核桃是因为在过去一周里，我摆放了七种不同的坚果和种子作为自助餐。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 保持口语化表达："I'm glad you asked"译为"很高兴你问起这个"，符合中文日常对话语气  
2. 专业术语准确处理："buffet"在实验场景下译为"自助餐"而非"自助餐厅"，保留科学实验的比喻色彩  
3. 逻辑显化："over the course of a week"译为"在过去一周里"比直译"经过一周"更符合中文时间表达习惯  
4. 文化适配："nuts and seeds"统一处理为"坚果和种子"，避免"果仁/籽实"等非常用说法  
5. 保留原文的解说性语气，通过"选择...是因为..."的句式再现因果逻辑关系）

原文: And all four times I repeated the experiment. Walnuts were always the one they ate first. What's great about placing this here is it levels the playing field as the birds can fly up and get as much food as they want anytime they need it. The squirrels, however, will have to work for it, because the only way to make it to this platform is if they work their way through my eight part ninja warrior obstacle course. Which all starts right here. This is the only platform on the course that has a pole that isn't covered and slippery stuff.
翻译: 我重复了四次实验，结果每次都是核桃最先被吃掉。  
把食物放在这里的妙处在于——它创造了一个公平竞争的环境：鸟儿可以随时飞上来尽情享用，而松鼠则必须付出努力。  
因为它们唯一能抵达这个平台的方式，就是通过我设计的八段忍者武士障碍赛道——起点就在这里。  
这是整个赛道中唯一设有裸露防滑杆的站台。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 将长句拆分为符合中文表达习惯的短句，如将"which all starts right here"独立成短句  
2. 使用"八段忍者武士障碍赛道"既保留"ninja warrior"的文化意象又符合中文四字格习惯

3. 保持简洁性：中文未添加冗余词汇，同时通过"才能"强化了原句隐含的必要性语气  
4. 术语统一："course"根据上下文译为"赛道"而非"课程"，符合极限运动/竞技场景）

原文: If they try and get up any other way, they can't keep a good grip and they just slide back down. So the first challenge is the bridge of instability.
翻译: 如果他们试图从其他方式攀爬，就无法保持稳固的抓握，只会滑落下去。因此，第一道难关就是这座不稳定的桥梁。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 将"get up"译为"攀爬"以符合中文在攀岩语境下的表达习惯  
2. "good grip"译为"稳固的抓握"准确传递了技术性动作  
3. 使用"难关"对应"challenge"既保留原文的挑战意味，又符合中文"闯关"的隐喻  
4. "bridge of instability"采用直译+补充手法，通过"这座"使指代更清晰  
5. 整体保持原文的指导性口吻和略微紧张的叙述节奏）

原文: Now, this may look easy, but the trick is it attaches at A single point on each end. And from a physics standpoint, that makes it no different than trying to crawl across a tightrope. It's the same deceptive principle with that one carnival game that's so impossible, I broke it down in another video where I used physics to show which carnival games were basically scams and the science on how to beat them. Next up, the maze of a thousand corridors. This one's a bit more cerebral, but if they make it through that, it will bring them to the pitchfork tumblers, which are inspired by the show Wipeout.
翻译: 现在，这看起来可能很简单，但关键在于它两端各只有一个固定点。从物理学角度来看，这无异于尝试在钢丝上爬行。同样的欺骗性原理也出现在那个几乎不可能赢的嘉年华游戏里——我在另一个视频中拆解过它，当时我用物理学原理揭示了哪些嘉年华游戏本质上是骗局，以及用科学方法攻克它们的诀窍。接下来是「千回廊迷宫」，这个更需要动脑筋。如果他们能成功通过，就会来到「三叉戟滚筒」关卡，这个项目的灵感来自电视节目《极限大挑战》。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 将"tightrope"译为"钢丝"符合中文马戏团杂技的常见表述  
2. "carnival game"统一译为"嘉年华游戏"保持品牌一致性  
3. "Wipeout"采用国内观众熟悉的译名《极限大挑战》而非直译  
4. "pitchfork tumblers"创造性译为"三叉戟滚筒"既保留原意又体现关卡特征  
5. 通过"拆解""攻克""诀窍"等词汇保持原视频解说风格的科技感与揭秘性  
6. 使用破折号和括号结构还原英语原文的插入语风格）

原文: But unlike Wipeout, I should point out that all these contraptions are squirrel friendly, and even with a little back force, they will break away and stop spinning. Now, if they can make it past the pitchfork tumblers of treachery, they come to one of my personal favorites, the Homewrecker.
翻译: 但不同于《Wipeout》游戏，我必须指出这些装置都对松鼠很友好——即便受到少许反向力，它们也会自动脱离并停止旋转。现在，如果它们能闯过阴险的干草叉滚筒阵，就会来到我个人最爱的关卡之一："家庭毁灭者"。

（翻译说明：  
1. 保留游戏名称《Wipeout》不译以维持文化指涉  
2. "squirrel friendly"译为"对松鼠友好"并添加破折号引导解释性内容  
3. "back force"译为专业术语"反向力"  
4. "pitchfork tumblers of treachery"运用四字格"阴险的干草叉滚筒阵"，既保留农具意象又强化戏剧性  
5. "Homewrecker"采用直译加引号处理，既保留原名冲击力又通过引号提示特殊含义  
6. 通过"关卡"补足游戏语境，使"来到"自然衔接）

原文: I put her in to tempt the squirrel to lose focus on the real prize at the end of the course. Because this pad has a pressure sensor underneath it, and it connects to a microcontroller that has a relay that connects to a solenoid that connects to a pneumatic piston that connects back to this platform with the pressure sensor. And so if they stand here for more than three seconds, they've got to start the course all over again. Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception. I've suspended a juicy walnut right in the middle, but there's no way this bridge will support their weight, so it'll be interesting to see how they approach it. The sixth challenge is called the Tourist Trap. It's actually a bit of a reward for making it this far. If the squirrel sticks their head through this board my wife painted, it's just a photo op they can hang on the wall of their tiny squirrel nest. I'll place a walnut here as an incentive for them not to miss this unique opportunity. The penultimate challenge are the quad steps of Great elevation. This is taken straight from Ninja Warrior, and this is super tricky because these paths are all totally smoothed and placed at a 45 degree incline. And now for the last challenge. At this point, they are a mere few feet away from their ultimate goal. But if they're not careful, they'll have to deal with the orbital assist platform ak the final countdown, AKA it's not a catapult, it's a squirrel, a pult.
翻译: 首先，我放这个装置是为了引诱松鼠在赛道终点分散注意力。因为这块垫子下方装有压力传感器，连接着微控制器上的继电器，继电器又连着电磁阀，电磁阀接着气动活塞，活塞最终又连回这个带压力传感器的平台。只要它们在这里停留超过三秒，就必须重新开始整个挑战。  

接下来是"欺骗弹簧桥"。我在桥中央悬吊了一颗诱人的核桃，但这座桥根本承受不住它们的体重，所以我很期待看它们会如何应对。  

第六关叫"游客陷阱"，其实算是给闯关者的奖励。如果松鼠把头探进这块我妻子绘制的木板，就能获得一张可以挂在它们小窝墙上的纪念照。我特意放了颗核桃在这里，确保它们不会错过这个独特的机会。  

倒数第二关是"四重天阶"。这个设计直接借鉴了《忍者勇士》，难度极高——所有踏板都被打磨得极其光滑，并以45度角倾斜放置。  

现在来到终极挑战。此时它们距离终极目标仅几步之遥，但稍有不慎就会触发"轨道辅助平台"（别名"最终倒计时"，别名"这不是弹射器——是松鼠发射器"）。  

（翻译说明：  
1. 专业术语如microcontroller/solenoid等采用行业通用译法  
2. "Slinky Bridge of Deception"创造性译为"欺骗弹簧桥"保留双关意味  
3. "it's not a catapult, it's a squirrel, a pult"通过破折号和重复结构还原英文文字游戏  
4. 保持原文科技宅幽默风格，如"游客陷阱"的温馨设定  
5. 长难句按中文习惯切分，如气动活塞那段采用链条式短句处理）

原文: Which means they now have to go back and start all the way over from the beginning. Now, if they want to avoid that fate, they just need to stand on this pad for less than three seconds. But once again, I've placed a diversion here. This one projects an optical illusion of anything you place in the bottom of this dish. It's actually super trippy and looks even more impressive in real life because the projected image is 3D.
翻译: 这意味着他们现在必须从头再来一遍。不过，如果想避免这种命运，他们只需在这个踏板上站立不到三秒。但这次我又设了个障眼法——这个装置能把放在底盘上的任何物体投射成光学幻象。效果特别迷幻，实际看起来更震撼，因为投射的影像是立体的。

（翻译说明：
1. 采用口语化表达如"障眼法"、"迷幻"保留原作的游戏化语气
2. "super trippy"译为"特别迷幻"既保留俚语感又符合中文表达
3. 将长句拆分为符合中文表达习惯的短句结构
4. "optical illusion"译为"光学幻象"准确传达技术概念
5. 通过"不过"、"但"等转折词保留原文的逻辑推进感
6. "3D"保留英文缩写符合中文科技语境习惯）

原文: They're like nine bucks on Amazon. And I put a link that explains the juicy physics of how they work in video description. Now, with regards to squirrel safety, I know I seem to have this reputation of improvised high speed projectiles, and so this one might worry a few animal lovers out there, including my wife. We have five pets and one child, and the child was the only one I had a say in. So rest assured, I can adjust the pressure on the piston, and we'll be staying way below any launch force that could hurt any of our adorable backyard contestants. And so, finally, after making it through all that, we're back here at the world's most satisfying bird feeder. And as far as I'm concerned, if they make it here, they've earned the right to gorge next to the birds for as long as they want. And so, after nearly a month of prep work, the course was officially open for business.
翻译: 它们在亚马逊上只卖九美元左右。我还在视频描述里放了个链接，详细解释了它们运作的趣味物理原理。至于松鼠安全问题——我知道自己总因临时起意发射高速抛射物"声名在外"，这个装置可能会让部分动物爱好者（包括我妻子）担心。我们家有五只宠物和一个孩子，其中只有孩子是我有权决定的。请放心，我可以调节活塞压力，确保发射力度远低于可能伤害这些可爱后院选手的阈值。那么历经万难后——我们终于回到了这台"全世界最解压的喂鸟器"面前。要我说，松鼠若能闯到这里，就有资格和鸟儿们一起尽情享用大餐。经过近一个月的筹备，这个障碍赛道终于正式营业了。

（翻译说明：  
1. 保留口语化表达如"声名在外""要我说"，体现原视频轻松幽默风格  
2. "juicy physics"译为"趣味物理原理"，既保留"多汁"的隐喻又符合中文科技视频常用表述  
3. 将"had a say in"意译为"有权决定的"，避免直译生硬感  
4. "adorable backyard contestants"译为"可爱后院选手"，既保留拟人化修辞又符合中文四字格习惯

Before making a selection and then gracefully leaping away, Fat Gus just goes for it, hands free, just makes himself real comfortable. Here he is laying out with a light snack from the bird feeder. I mean, you can't fault the guy for just clearly appreciating a good meal. So now that you Know our four contenders.

翻译: 需要说明的是，松鼠们在早晨6点到10点最为活跃，因此我每天天不亮就得起床，从家里开始拍摄。活像个伪装潜伏的自然摄影师，只不过是在郊区版本。我还架设了几台24小时不间断拍摄的摄像机，这才有了诸如"我们养了全世界最差劲的看门狗"之类的发现。谢啦伙计，你可真帮大忙了。

原文: Now back to the homewrecker. You can see Rick is instinctively suspicious of this gold digger and only for a brief moment puts his full weight on the platform. I told you he was smart. His buddy Marty, on the other hand, she is a cruel mistress. And because I know my wife is going to ask me, no, this will not hurt the squirrel for two reasons. Number one, they are amazing like cats and always land on their feet. And two, they themselves were jumping from this height all the time. And in some cases, much higher. In fact, squirrels are one of the few mammals that can survive a fall from any height because they make their terminal velocity so low. You can see it right here. They make their body as flat as possible, then put their tail back to increase drag. They basically become their own parachute. And then right before they land, they pull in and fully extend their arms and legs to act as shock absorbing landing gear. This is so cool. Now back to the course where even Smart Rick eventually lets his guard down, which is exactly when she strikes. But just like all the other obstacles so far, after a day or two they'd mastered it. In this case even disregarding her offering of a fresh walnut. Now onto the Slinky bridge of deception. And this was the sleeper obstacle. In my book, that is not a large gap which they can easily jump, but having the Slinky there just threw them off somehow. You can see how much Frank is struggling here and he's the brave one. And Rick only jumps when Marty shows up for emotional support.
翻译: 现在回到这个破坏家庭的小三身上。你能看出瑞克本能地对这个拜金女充满戒心，只有短暂片刻完全站上了平台。我说过他很聪明。而他搭档马蒂则相反——这装置是个残酷的女主人。我知道妻子肯定会问我，所以提前声明：这不会伤害松鼠，原因有二。其一，它们像猫一样神奇总能四脚着地；其二，它们自己就经常从这种高度跳跃，有时甚至更高。事实上，松鼠是少数能从任意高度坠落存活的哺乳动物，因为它们能把终端速度降到极低。看这里：它们尽量摊平身体，后摆尾巴增加阻力，简直像自备降落伞。临着陆时又蜷缩身体，完全伸展四肢作为缓冲起落架——太酷了！回到挑战路线，连聪明的瑞克最终也放松警惕，而机关就在此刻发动。但和前几个障碍一样，一两天后它们就完全掌握了技巧，这次甚至无视了新鲜核桃的诱惑。接下来是欺骗性的弹簧桥，这才是真正的黑马障碍。在我看来那缝隙根本不算宽，它们本可轻松跳过，但弹簧的存在莫名干扰了判断。看看弗兰克挣扎得多厉害——他可是勇敢担当。而瑞克只有在马蒂赶来精神支持时才敢起跳。

5. "sleeper obstacle"译为"黑马障碍"比直译"沉睡障碍"更符合中文认知）

翻译: 原来“胖格斯”不是个爷们儿，还怀了孕。这下我突然觉得之前那些关于体重的玩笑话特别不合适。于是我们赶紧转移话题缓和气氛，接着继续向海拔极高的四方阶梯进发。

And yet for some reason he decides his 12 foot jump is his best course of action.
翻译: 让我们放慢镜头看看。它们的跳跃能力实在惊人，所以这么快掌握技巧也不意外。看这里，这一跳估计有十英尺高。接下来是弗兰克经典的"勇猛但犯傻"时刻——明明已经正常进入赛道，至少成功闯到"房屋破坏者"关卡十几次了。可不知为什么，他偏偏觉得12英尺的飞跃才是最佳选择。

原文: Smartrick was the first one to enter the course. So in the end, after about a week of effort, it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first. And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse. In hindsight, we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter. Here's Marty, as always, not far behind he's also a bit flighty, as you know, which worked against him here, because down below, Fantastic Gus, ever the opportunist, comes through with a real stroke of brilliance. But pretty soon, Marty comes back like, um, I'm the one who kind of earned that. And then Fantastic Gus is like, you snooze, you lose, sucker. And might I just say, Fantastic Gus, when you sit like that, you don't look an ounce over 700 grams. Eventually, they learned that sound was a good thing, and they'd quickly return for their reward before Fantastic Gus got any ideas. So here's a single camera shot of a full run, and by the end, all of them could do the full course in less than 40 seconds. And while we're watching, you might be wondering what happened to the squirrel a put. Unfortunately, they didn't really fall for my illusion much. But I'm about to show you the two times they did. And as a promise to my wife, I turned the pressure to only 40% full power. So the acceleration the squirrel would feel is about half a g, which is 10 times less than a typical roller coaster. Additionally, I never turned on either the Homewrecker trapdoor or the launch platform when I wasn't actively watching from inside my house, where I had a manual override button. Because as safe as it was, something about launching fantastic gusts just didn't feel right. Now what you're about to see is gonna look pretty chaotic, but when we check the slow mo, amazingly, I'll show you how the squirrel is totally in control pretty much the whole time.
翻译: 智能里克（Smartrick）是第一个进入赛道的。因此，经过约一周的努力后，由它最先抵达大奖终点可谓实至名归。它兴奋极了，甚至想倒着重新跑完全程。现在回想起来，或许我们该把大奖机关做得安静些。看，马蒂（Marty）一如既往紧随其后——你们也知道这家伙有点毛躁，这反而害了他，因为下方的"神奇格斯"（Fantastic Gus）抓住机会，来了个绝妙操作。但很快马蒂就杀了回来，仿佛在说"这奖励本该是我的"。而神奇格斯则摆出"手慢无，菜鸟"的架势。恕我直言格斯，你那个坐姿看起来绝对不止700克重。后来它们意识到声音意味着好事，就会赶在格斯动歪脑筋前火速领取奖励。这是全程的单镜头记录，最终它们都能在40秒内完成赛道。观影时你或许会好奇松鼠们的去向——可惜它们没怎么中我的幻术陷阱。不过接下来我会展示仅有的两次成功案例。向妻子承诺过，我把压力调至仅40%功率，松鼠承受的加速度约0.5个G，是普通过山车的十分之一。而且只要我没在屋里亲自监看（配有紧急停止按钮），就绝不会启动"家庭破坏者"活板门或弹射平台。尽管安全措施周全，但弹射神奇格斯总让我心里不踏实。接下来画面看似混乱，但慢镜头将揭示惊人真相：松鼠其实全程都掌控着局面。

（翻译说明：  
1. 保留所有角色昵称的个性化翻译风格，如"Fantastic Gus"译为"神奇格斯"既保留原名又体现角色特质  
2. 处理口语化表达时采用中文对应俗语："you snooze, you lose, sucker"译为"手慢无，菜鸟"

原文: Alright, now here's a second angle.
翻译: 好的，现在换个角度再来一次。  

（翻译说明：根据原文轻松自然的语气，将"second angle"译为"换个角度"更符合中文口语表达习惯，同时"再来一次"隐含了重复动作的意味，与视频演示场景契合。保留了原句简洁明快的特点，未添加额外信息。）

原文: Also, even if you don't trust my calculations, I can assure you that the squirrels did not care. In both launch cases, they were back up on the course in like five minutes. Here's the slo mo and see if you can spot the two critical things he does to make sure he lands feet down.
翻译: 此外，即便你不相信我的计算结果，我也可以向你保证——松鼠们根本不在乎。在两次发射过程中，它们都只用了五分钟就重新回到跑道上。现在看慢动作镜头，注意观察它为确保四肢着地所做的两个关键动作。

（说明：译文通过以下处理实现自然流畅的中文表达：

原文: Did you catch it? The first critical moment is right here. He's already done the predictive math and he's locked his head on the spot where he plans to land. And now his head will not lose that lock the whole way down.
翻译: 你注意到了吗？第一个关键时刻就在这里。  
他已经完成了预判计算，并将头部锁定在计划着陆的位置。  
从现在起，他的头部将全程保持锁定，直至落地。

原文: That blows my mind. But if you think about it, it makes sense. These reactions would have evolved to be razor sharp. If you live your life in the trees constantly making split second decisions. Now, besides picking a landing spot with his head, the second trick is with his arm. When he wants to keep his upper body from rotating, he has his arms out. But the moment he wants to rotate his upper body quickly, he tucks them in. And then when he wants to stop rotating, he extends them out again. This is straight up conservation of angular momentum. It's the same trick ice skaters use.
翻译: 这简直让我震惊。但仔细想想，这确实合乎逻辑。这些反应能力在进化过程中必然变得极其敏锐——毕竟它们生活在树冠层，每时每刻都需要做出瞬间判断。除了用头部选择落点外，他的第二个诀窍在于手臂的运用：当需要保持上半身稳定时，他会张开双臂；而需要快速旋转时，就立即收拢手臂；若要停止旋转，又再次伸展双臂。这完全符合角动量守恒定律，和花样滑冰选手使用的技巧如出一辙。

（翻译说明：
1. "blows my mind"译为"简直让我震惊"保留惊叹语气
2. "razor sharp"用"极其敏锐"体现进化形成的精准性
3. "split second decisions"译为"瞬间判断"符合中文四字格表达习惯
4. 将三个手臂动作的并列结构处理为排比句式，增强节奏感

6. 末句"如出一辙"的成语使用既保持专业又增添文采）

原文: Basically bring your limbs in if you want to rotate fast, extend them out if you want to slow the rotation. My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day also made a video analyzing how cats always land on their feet and they do the exact same two tricks. The head target lock and bringing lens into rotate and out to stop rotation. Here's the second launch.
翻译: 基本上，想要快速旋转就收紧四肢，想减速就伸展肢体。我的好友Destin来自《每天更聪明》频道，他也做过一期视频分析猫为何总能四脚着地——它们用的正是这两招：头部锁定目标，以及收腿加速旋转、伸腿停止转动。现在来看第二次发射。

（翻译说明：
1. 专业术语处理："Smarter Every Day"保留英文名并补充"频道"二字，符合中文观众对科普频道的认知习惯
2. 动作描写："bring in/extend out"译为"收紧/伸展"更符合中文肢体动作表达

5. 语气匹配：使用"正是这两招"等口语化表达，还原原视频轻松科普的语气）

原文: This is a bird feeder. And everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an eight part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
翻译: 这是一个喂鸟器。而我左侧的所有装置，都是为了让松鼠无法得手。如果它们想偷吃鸟食，首先得通过这个堪称松鼠版"忍者勇士"的八重障碍关卡。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "squirrel proof"译为"让松鼠无法得手"，既保留幽默感又符合中文口语表达

3. 使用"堪称"强化原句夸张语气，保留戏谑风格  
4. 通过"偷吃"等动词生动还原松鼠的顽皮形象）

原文: This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart, but out of the gate. I will admit that in hindsight that I completely underestimated my adversary. Now, if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a bird watcher. And it was just so lovely until they showed up.
翻译: 这门课程极具挑战性，绝非胆小之辈所能胜任。但坦白说，回顾当初，我完全低估了这个对手的厉害。若你好奇我为何自找麻烦，故事得从八周前说起——那时我困在家中百无聊赖，便装了喂鸟器想当个观鸟者。原本岁月静好，直到它们出现。  

（翻译说明：  
1. "not for the timid of heart"译为"绝非胆小之辈所能胜任"，既保留比喻又符合中文四字格表达

原文: This is a bird feeder. And everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an eight part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
翻译: 这是一个喂鸟器。我左边所做的一切都是为了防松鼠。如果它们想吃鸟食，首先得通过这个专为松鼠设计的八段式忍者勇士障碍赛。

原文: This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart, but out of the gate. I will admit that in hindsight that I completely underestimated my adversary. Now, if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a bird watcher. And it was just so lovely until they showed up.
翻译: 这门课程极具挑战性，绝非胆小之辈所能驾驭。坦白说，事后回想起来，我完全低估了这个对手。若你好奇我为何自找苦吃，得追溯到八周前——当时我困在家中百无聊赖，便装了喂鸟器决心当个观鸟者。原本一切岁月静好，直到它们出现。

原文: Now, luckily, my bird feeder had a wire cage around it. Big enough for the birds to slip inside, but small enough to prevent the squirrels from getting the food. And that worked really well until right here. For me, this was like the moment in Jurassic park when they realized the velociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn't their first rodeo. They basically cleared this whole tube of birdseed by the end of the day. Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised as being squirrel proof. So I bought another squirrel proof bird feeder to replace it. It's got this outer cage suspended by some springs. And so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn't weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes, it'll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no idea how the squirrels could possibly outsmart this, but let's see. And this one worked exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it. But when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts down. And now all the seed ports are covered up. Every time they tried, it was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springs that hold the cage up, which means the cage stays in the lowered position where it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now they can get to the lid. But this bird feeder lid doesn't hinge open to give direct access. So he goes with a different tactic where he now has access to all the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try one more bird feeder design.
翻译: 幸运的是，我的喂鸟器外围装了铁丝网笼。笼孔大小刚好能让鸟儿钻入，又能阻止松鼠偷食。这招一直很管用——直到此刻。对我来说，这简直像《侏罗纪公园》里人们发现迅猛龙会转门把手的震撼场景。而且大门敞开时，明显能看出它们早已轻车熟路。到天黑前，这群家伙几乎把整管鸟食洗劫一空。要知道这个喂鸟器当初可是打着"防松鼠"的旗号卖的。于是我又买了个号称防松鼠的新款，这次的设计是用弹簧悬吊外笼——鸟儿停驻时体重轻，笼子不动就能吃到种子；但松鼠一抓上来，体重就会压沉弹簧笼，封住取食口。我实在想不出松鼠还能怎么破解，且看吧。起初效果完美：鸟儿欢快地进食，松鼠一来笼子就下沉遮住所有食槽，屡试不爽。结果第二天清晨，这家伙居然解开了固定弹簧的卡扣，导致笼子持续处于下沉状态。虽然食槽被挡住了，但它们因此能碰到顶盖。这个顶盖本不是铰链式设计，无法直接掀开。于是它换了策略，最终畅通无阻地吃光了所有存粮。看来我得再换第三种喂鸟器了。

原文: Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one's supposed to work well because it's got this baffle which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight down and getting to the seeds.
翻译: 好吧。哇哦。这简直像是故意的。这个应该好用，因为它有个挡板，能防止松鼠直接下来吃到种子。

原文: And more importantly, there's no way for them to Rip this off. We'll see.
翻译: 更重要的是，他们绝无可能剽窃这个创意。我们走着瞧。

原文: This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes. This is when I really started to gain an appreciation for what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feeder was their favorite. Okay, yeah, they're flexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan was forming in my head. But just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can't say I was surprised when they just climbed it. Nor was I surprised to see they could shimmy up and down a small metal pole, or even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb a certain pole material was a moot point anyways. Because of this. Look at this. These guys are basically freaking rodent sized.
翻译: 这只松鼠初次亮相时表现相似。当它仅用几根脚趾悬挂时，我才真正开始意识到它们的能耐。这个喂鸟器显然是它们的最爱。好吧，它们绝对是在向我炫耀。此刻，我脑海中已酝酿出一个计划。但为了彻底验证，我把立柱移到了远离围栏的地方。当看到它们照样攀爬而上时，我丝毫不觉意外。它们能在细金属杆甚至粗杆上灵活上下攀爬，同样不足为奇。其实讨论它们能否攀爬某种材质的杆子已毫无意义——看看这个，这些家伙简直和啮齿动物差不多大。

原文: Simone Biles. And on some level, this is what it felt like when someone stole a package from my porch that didn't belong to them. And I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the glitter bomb bait package.
翻译: 西蒙·拜尔斯。某种程度上，这就像有人从我门廊偷走了不属于他们的包裹时我的感受。我利用了这种愤慨，花了一年时间设计出这个闪光炸弹诱饵包裹。

原文: Hello. Complete with special fragrances. If I could design a package to deter thieves, could I design a bird feeder to deter squirrels?
翻译: 你好。搭配独特香氛。如果我能设计一个防盗包装，那我能不能设计一个防松鼠的喂鸟器？

原文: And so, after a couple weeks of brainstorming, designing and building with my buddy John, we put it all together in this 22nd build montage.
翻译: 于是，在和我朋友约翰一起头脑风暴、设计和搭建了几周后，我们将所有成果浓缩在了这第22个制作集锦中。

原文: Here are the basic elements. For starters, here's where I've placed their favorite bird feeder at the end of the course.
翻译: 以下是基本要素。首先，我在课程末尾放置了他们最爱的喂鸟器。

原文: And to sweeten the deal, right below that there's a trap door.
翻译: 为了让交易更诱人，就在那下面还有个暗门。

原文: And if they step here, it releases a butt ton of walnuts and unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts?
翻译: 如果他们踩到这里，就会释放出一大堆核桃，还会展开一些庆祝横幅。为什么是核桃呢？

原文: I'm glad you asked. I'm using walnuts because over the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven different nuts and seeds.
翻译: 很高兴你问起这个。我选择核桃是因为在一周的时间里，我摆出了七种不同的坚果和种子作为自助餐。

原文: And all four times I repeated the experiment. Walnuts were always the one they ate first. What's great about placing this here is it levels the playing field as the birds can fly up and get as much food as they want anytime they need it. The squirrels, however, will have to work for it, because the only way to make it to this platform is if they work their way through my eight part ninja warrior obstacle course. Which all starts right here. This is the only platform on the course that has a pole that isn't covered and slippery stuff.
翻译: 我重复了四次实验，结果每次都是核桃最先被吃掉。把食物放在这里的好处在于，它创造了一个公平的竞争环境——鸟儿随时都能飞上来尽情享用，而松鼠却得费一番功夫。因为它们必须通过我设计的八段忍者武士障碍赛道，才能抵达这个平台。一切从这里开始，这是整条赛道上唯一没有覆盖防滑涂层的立柱平台。

原文: Which means this is where they have to climb up to enter the course.
翻译: 这意味着他们必须从这里爬上去才能进入赛道。

原文: If they try and get up any other way, they can't keep a good grip and they just slide back down. So the first challenge is the bridge of instability.
翻译: 如果他们试图用其他方式攀爬，就无法保持稳固的抓握，只会滑落下去。因此，第一道挑战就是这座不稳定的桥梁。

原文: Now, this may look easy, but the trick is it attaches at A single point on each end. And from a physics standpoint, that makes it no different than trying to crawl across a tightrope. It's the same deceptive principle with that one carnival game that's so impossible, I broke it down in another video where I used physics to show which carnival games were basically scams and the science on how to beat them. Next up, the maze of a thousand corridors. This one's a bit more cerebral, but if they make it through that, it will bring them to the pitchfork tumblers, which are inspired by the show Wipeout.
翻译: 现在，这看起来可能很简单，但关键在于它两端各只有一个固定点。从物理学角度来看，这和走钢丝没什么区别。就像那个看似简单实则坑人的嘉年华游戏一样——我在另一期视频里用物理学原理拆穿过哪些嘉年华游戏其实是骗局，还科普了破解方法。接下来是千回百转的迷宫，这个更考验脑力。若能成功穿越，等待他们的将是灵感源自《极限闯关》节目的三叉戟滚筒阵。

原文: But unlike Wipeout, I should point out that all these contraptions are squirrel friendly, and even with a little back force, they will break away and stop spinning. Now, if they can make it past the pitchfork tumblers of treachery, they come to one of my personal favorites, the Homewrecker.
翻译: 但不同于《Wipeout》，我必须指出所有这些装置都对松鼠很友好，即便受到一点反向力，它们也会断开并停止旋转。现在，如果它们能闯过那阴险的干草叉滚筒，就会来到我个人最爱的关卡之一——"家庭破坏者"。

原文: I put her in to tempt the squirrel to lose focus on the real prize at the end of the course. Because this pad has a pressure sensor underneath it, and it connects to a microcontroller that has a relay that connects to a solenoid that connects to a pneumatic piston that connects back to this platform with the pressure sensor. And so if they stand here for more than three seconds, they've got to start the course all over again. Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception. I've suspended a juicy walnut right in the middle, but there's no way this bridge will support their weight, so it'll be interesting to see how they approach it. The sixth challenge is called the Tourist Trap. It's actually a bit of a reward for making it this far. If the squirrel sticks their head through this board my wife painted, it's just a photo op they can hang on the wall of their tiny squirrel nest. I'll place a walnut here as an incentive for them not to miss this unique opportunity. The penultimate challenge are the quad steps of Great elevation. This is taken straight from Ninja Warrior, and this is super tricky because these paths are all totally smoothed and placed at a 45 degree incline. And now for the last challenge. At this point, they are a mere few feet away from their ultimate goal. But if they're not careful, they'll have to deal with the orbital assist platform ak the final countdown, AKA it's not a catapult, it's a squirrel, a pult.
翻译: 我把她放进去是为了引诱松鼠分心，忽略赛道终点的真正奖励。因为这块垫子下面装有压力传感器，连接着微控制器，控制器通过继电器驱动电磁阀，再联动气动活塞，最终又回到这个带压力传感器的平台。如果它们在这里停留超过三秒，就必须从头开始闯关。接下来是"欺骗弹簧桥"，我在桥中央悬吊了一颗多汁的核桃，但这座桥根本承受不住它们的体重，真想看看它们会如何应对。第六关叫"游客陷阱"，算是给闯关到这里的奖励——只要松鼠把头探进我妻子绘制的这块木板，就能获得一张可以挂在松鼠窝墙上的纪念照。我会在这里放颗核桃，确保它们不会错过这个独特机会。倒数第二关是"四重天阶"，直接借鉴了《忍者勇士》的设计，这些完全光滑的踏板呈45度倾斜排列，难度极高。现在来到最终挑战，此时它们距离终极目标仅几步之遥。但若稍有不慎，就得面对"轨道辅助平台"——又名最终倒计时，又名"这不是弹弓，是松鼠发射器"。

原文: Which means they now have to go back and start all the way over from the beginning. Now, if they want to avoid that fate, they just need to stand on this pad for less than three seconds. But once again, I've placed a diversion here. This one projects an optical illusion of anything you place in the bottom of this dish. It's actually super trippy and looks even more impressive in real life because the projected image is 3D.
翻译: 这意味着他们现在必须从头再来一遍。如果他们想避免这种命运，只需在这个垫子上站立不到三秒。但又一次，我在这里设了个障眼法。这个装置能将你放在盘子底部的任何东西投射成光学幻象。实际上效果非常迷幻，现实中看起来更震撼，因为投射的影像是3D的。

原文: They're like nine bucks on Amazon. And I put a link that explains the juicy physics of how they work in video description. Now, with regards to squirrel safety, I know I seem to have this reputation of improvised high speed projectiles, and so this one might worry a few animal lovers out there, including my wife. We have five pets and one child, and the child was the only one I had a say in. So rest assured, I can adjust the pressure on the piston, and we'll be staying way below any launch force that could hurt any of our adorable backyard contestants. And so, finally, after making it through all that, we're back here at the world's most satisfying bird feeder. And as far as I'm concerned, if they make it here, they've earned the right to gorge next to the birds for as long as they want. And so, after nearly a month of prep work, the course was officially open for business.
翻译: 它们在亚马逊上大概九美元一个。我在视频描述里放了链接，详细解释了它们运作的物理原理。至于松鼠的安全问题，我知道我总给人留下即兴高速发射器的印象，所以这次可能会让一些动物爱好者担心，包括我妻子。我们家有五只宠物和一个孩子，其中只有孩子是我能说了算的。不过请放心，我可以调节活塞压力，确保发射力度远低于可能伤害这些可爱后院选手的水平。终于，在搞定这一切之后，我们又回到了这个世界上最令人满足的喂鸟器前。在我看来，如果它们能闯到这里，就有权像鸟儿一样尽情享用美食，想待多久都行。经过近一个月的筹备，这个赛道终于正式开放营业了。

原文: They could smell the walnuts at the final station, and you could see the gears turning because right above that was their favorite bird feeder.
翻译: 他们在终点站闻到了核桃的香气，抬头一看，正上方就是他们最爱的喂鸟器，顿时恍然大悟。

原文: And so, before long, we had our first contender that didn't exactly go as planned. So Rick decides to regroup. Speaking of which, that's Rick. There are a total of four competitors that will be attempting the course. First up is Rick, and he weighs five.
翻译: 很快，我们迎来了第一位挑战者，但事情并未按计划发展。于是，里克决定重整旗鼓。说到里克，就是他。共有四位选手将尝试这条赛道，打头阵的是体重五磅的里克。

原文: I know this because he's actually standing on a custom made scale. Rick is very clever, as you'll see here in a minute, but he also gets spooked easily.
翻译: 我知道这一点是因为他实际上正站在一个特制的秤上。瑞克非常聪明，你马上就能看到，但他也容易受到惊吓。

原文: Next up is Marty. He's basically indistinguishable from Rick. Rick and Marty are inseparable and pretty much spend all their time together as a pair.
翻译: 接下来是马蒂。他和瑞克简直是一个模子刻出来的。瑞克和马蒂形影不离，几乎总是成双成对地待在一起。

原文: Our third contender is Frank, also coming in around 500 grams.
翻译: 我们的第三位参赛者是弗兰克，体重也在500克左右。

原文: He's very gutsy. He's also kind of dumb. Finally, we've got my personal favorite, Fat Gus. He's just really charming and will strike a pose if he sees a camera. He also really likes to eat, and he tips the scales at an impressive 800 grams. While most of the squirrels are kind of particular. Before making a selection and then gracefully leaping away, Fat Gus just goes for it, hands free, just makes himself real comfortable. Here he is laying out with a light snack from the bird feeder. I mean, you can't fault the guy for just clearly appreciating a good meal. So now that you Know our four contenders.
翻译: 他胆子特别大，也有点傻乎乎的。最后是我个人最爱的胖格斯，他魅力十足，一看到相机就会摆姿势。他还特别贪吃，体重达到了惊人的800克。其他松鼠大多比较挑剔，会精挑细选后才优雅地跳走，但胖格斯直接上手，毫不拘束，怎么舒服怎么来。看他在喂鸟器旁悠闲地吃着零食，你实在没法责怪这家伙——人家就是懂得享受美食嘛。现在你认识我们的四位选手了。

原文: Let's get back to Rick. So he hops back on, and he's actually doing better than his first attempt. Just barely.
翻译: 咱们说回里克。他重新骑上车，这次表现比第一次尝试稍好一些，但也只是好那么一点点。

原文: This is the best. Because he's like, okay, I got this.
翻译: 这简直太棒了。因为他一副胸有成竹的样子，好像在说"没问题，交给我"。

原文: Never mind. Well, maybe I. No, I definitely don't.
翻译: 算了。好吧，也许我...不，我肯定不。

原文: And this was the exact moment I realized I just might be outmatched here.
翻译: 就在这一刻，我意识到自己可能真的不是对手。

原文: Marty was watching Rick, and after a quick dip of his toes in the water, adopts his strategy right out of the gate. Oof. So close.
翻译: 马蒂观察着里克的举动，刚试探性地碰了碰水，就立刻照搬了他的策略。哎呀，就差那么一点。

原文: But an excellent recovery. And Fat Gus, perhaps predictably, comes up a little short. Which brings us to the maze of a thousand corridors, which, to be honest, they mastered this one pretty quickly.
翻译: 但恢复得相当出色。而胖格斯，或许不出所料，还是稍逊一筹。这就带我们来到了千回百转的迷宫，说实话，他们这次掌握得相当快。

原文: Here's a solid run from Fat Gus.
翻译: 这是胖子格斯的一次稳健跑动。

原文: And now for the pitchfork tumblers of treachery. Marty was like, yeah, that's a hard pass. Fat Gus is just like, abort. Frank is just like, nope. Then he's like, wait a second. Mm. Still nope.
翻译: 现在轮到这些背信弃义的草叉杂耍者了。马蒂直接表示："不了，敬谢不敏。"胖格斯干脆说："撤。"弗兰克刚开始也说："没门。"接着他突然顿了顿："嗯......还是算了。"

原文: Then Marty flies in real hot over the top. He did make it through, but that's partial credit as far as I'm concerned. And then here's Fat Gus with my favorite attempt by far.
翻译: 接着马蒂从正上方高速俯冲而下。他确实成功穿过了，但在我看来只能算勉强及格。然后胖格斯出场，目前为止我最喜欢的挑战就数他了。

原文: And then Frank shows no fear, which helps him pull off this near flawless run.
翻译: 接着弗兰克毫无惧色，这让他近乎完美地完成了这次行动。

原文: And finally, Smart Rick surgically weaves his way through essentially untouched.
翻译: 最终，机灵鬼里克毫发无损地巧妙穿行而过。

原文: And I should mention the squirrels were Most active from 6 to 10am so every morning I've been getting up before the sunrise to start filming from in my house. Like when of those camouflage nature photographers, only like a suburbanized version. I've also had a handful of streaming cameras rolling 24 7, which has allowed me to make such discoveries as we have the world's worst guard dog. Thanks for the help, pal.
翻译: 值得一提的是，松鼠们在早上6点到10点最为活跃，所以我每天天不亮就得起床，从家里开始拍摄。就像那些伪装潜伏的自然摄影师一样，只不过我这是郊区版本。我还架设了几台24小时不间断拍摄的摄像头，这才发现我们家养了全世界最不靠谱的看门狗。谢啦伙计，你可真帮大忙了。

原文: Now back to the homewrecker. You can see Rick is instinctively suspicious of this gold digger and only for a brief moment puts his full weight on the platform. I told you he was smart. His buddy Marty, on the other hand, she is a cruel mistress. And because I know my wife is going to ask me, no, this will not hurt the squirrel for two reasons. Number one, they are amazing like cats and always land on their feet. And two, they themselves were jumping from this height all the time. And in some cases, much higher. In fact, squirrels are one of the few mammals that can survive a fall from any height because they make their terminal velocity so low. You can see it right here. They make their body as flat as possible, then put their tail back to increase drag. They basically become their own parachute. And then right before they land, they pull in and fully extend their arms and legs to act as shock absorbing landing gear. This is so cool. Now back to the course where even Smart Rick eventually lets his guard down, which is exactly when she strikes. But just like all the other obstacles so far, after a day or two they'd mastered it. In this case even disregarding her offering of a fresh walnut. Now onto the Slinky bridge of deception. And this was the sleeper obstacle. In my book, that is not a large gap which they can easily jump, but having the Slinky there just threw them off somehow. You can see how much Frank is struggling here and he's the brave one. And Rick only jumps when Marty shows up for emotional support.
翻译: 现在回到这个破坏家庭的小三身上。可以看到瑞克本能地对这个拜金女充满戒心，只在极短时间内完全站上平台。我说过他很聪明。而他伙伴马蒂就惨了，这机关是个残忍的 mistress（女主人）。提前回答我妻子肯定会问的问题：不会伤害松鼠，原因有二。其一，它们像猫一样总能四脚着地；其二，它们本就常从这种高度跳跃，有时甚至更高。事实上，松鼠是少数能从任意高度坠落存活的哺乳动物，因其终端速度极低。看这里——它们尽量摊平身体，后摆尾巴增加阻力，简直自带降落伞。临落地时又蜷缩伸展四肢，变成缓冲起落架。太酷了！回到挑战路线，连聪明的瑞克最终也放松警惕，此刻机关突然发难。但就像之前所有障碍，一两天后它们就驾轻就熟，这次甚至无视了新鲜核桃的诱惑。接下来是欺骗性十足的弹簧桥，这才是隐藏杀手。在我看来那缝隙根本不算宽，但弹簧的存在莫名干扰了它们。看看勇敢的弗兰克有多挣扎，而瑞克只在马蒂赶来精神支持时才敢跳。

原文: But like all the obstacles so far, after a day or two, they'd mastered it. Now onto our third to last obstacle, the tourist trap.
翻译: 但就像之前的所有障碍一样，过了一两天，他们便成功克服了。现在来到倒数第三个障碍——旅游陷阱。

原文: And this one was just a freaking delight. A little peanut butter really did the trick here.
翻译: 这个简直太让人惊喜了。加点花生酱效果立竿见影。

原文: Now here comes Fat Gus and I mean, how Fat Gus is this?
翻译: 现在登场的是胖格斯，我是说，这家伙到底能有多胖？

原文: He sees the camera and he's like, paint me like one of your French squirrels.
翻译: 他看到镜头后就说，把我画成你笔下的法国松鼠吧。

原文: Yeah. No, no takers. Alright, here's another classic Gus, where he looks at the camera.
翻译: 是啊。没人接茬。好吧，再来个格斯经典镜头——他直勾勾盯着摄像机。

原文: Wait a second. Play that back.
翻译: 等一下。把那段回放一下。

原文: And freeze, zoom, enhance.
翻译: 定格，放大，增强。

原文: Well, turns out Fat Gus is not a dude and he's pregnant. Which meant I was suddenly feeling real uncomfortable about all those weight comments. So after a bit of a pivot to smooth things over, we soldiered on to the quad steps of great elevation.
翻译: 呃，原来胖格斯不是个爷们儿，还怀着孕呢。这下我突然觉得之前那些关于体重的玩笑话特别不合适。于是稍微转了个话题缓和气氛后，我们继续向海拔极高的四方台阶进发。

原文: Frank comes in rather confident, almost his demise, but he pulls off the smooth recovery.
翻译: 弗兰克进来时相当自信，几乎自取灭亡，但他还是巧妙地挽回了局面。

原文: So after not much time at all, they were looking pretty good here. In fact, one morning I noticed Marty totally skipped the last step altogether, which I took as a challenge. And so I removed the middle step to see what they would do. And who else but Fantastic Gus?
翻译: 没过多久，它们在这里就表现得相当不错了。事实上，有天早上我注意到马蒂完全跳过了最后一步，这激起了我的好胜心。于是我又撤掉了中间的台阶，想看看它们会怎么做。果然不出所料——除了神奇格斯还能有谁？

原文: Let's slow that down a bit. They're such amazing jumpers, so I suppose the quick mastery here wasn't a surprise. I mean, this right here is probably a ten foot jump. And here's some classic brave but dumb Frank. He'd already entered the course normally and made it to the home wrecker at least a dozen times by this point. And yet for some reason he decides his 12 foot jump is his best course of action.
翻译: 咱们放慢点看。它们的跳跃能力太惊人了，所以这么快掌握技巧也不意外。你看这里，估计得有十英尺的跳跃高度。再看看弗兰克这经典又莽撞的操作——明明已经正常进入赛道，至少成功闯到"拆家神器"关卡十几次了。可不知为啥，他偏觉得12英尺的信仰之跃才是最佳选择。

原文: Smartrick was the first one to enter the course. So in the end, after about a week of effort, it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first. And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse. In hindsight, we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter. Here's Marty, as always, not far behind he's also a bit flighty, as you know, which worked against him here, because down below, Fantastic Gus, ever the opportunist, comes through with a real stroke of brilliance. But pretty soon, Marty comes back like, um, I'm the one who kind of earned that. And then Fantastic Gus is like, you snooze, you lose, sucker. And might I just say, Fantastic Gus, when you sit like that, you don't look an ounce over 700 grams. Eventually, they learned that sound was a good thing, and they'd quickly return for their reward before Fantastic Gus got any ideas. So here's a single camera shot of a full run, and by the end, all of them could do the full course in less than 40 seconds. And while we're watching, you might be wondering what happened to the squirrel a put. Unfortunately, they didn't really fall for my illusion much. But I'm about to show you the two times they did. And as a promise to my wife, I turned the pressure to only 40% full power. So the acceleration the squirrel would feel is about half a g, which is 10 times less than a typical roller coaster. Additionally, I never turned on either the Homewrecker trapdoor or the launch platform when I wasn't actively watching from inside my house, where I had a manual override button. Because as safe as it was, something about launching fantastic gusts just didn't feel right. Now what you're about to see is gonna look pretty chaotic, but when we check the slow mo, amazingly, I'll show you how the squirrel is totally in control pretty much the whole time.
翻译: 斯玛特里克是第一个进入赛道的。因此，经过约一周的努力后，由他最先抵达大奖位置再合适不过。他兴奋极了，甚至想倒着跑完全程。现在回想起来，我们或许该把大奖机关做得安静些。看马蒂，一如既往紧随其后——你也知道这家伙有点毛躁，这反倒害了他，因为下方的神奇格斯抓住机会，来了个绝妙操作。但很快马蒂就杀回来，像是说"这功劳该归我吧"，而神奇格斯则回敬"手慢无，蠢货"。恕我直言神奇格斯，你那个坐姿看起来连700克都没有。后来它们发现声响是好事，总能在神奇格斯动歪脑筋前赶回来领奖。这是全程的单镜头记录，到最后它们都能在40秒内跑完全程。观看时你或许会好奇那只松鼠去哪了——可惜它们很少中我的幻术圈套，不过接下来我会展示仅有的两次成功案例。向妻子保证过，我只将压力调到40%功率，松鼠承受的加速度约0.5个G，比过山车低十倍。只要我没在屋里盯着监控手动操作，就绝不会启动"家庭破坏者"活板门或弹射台——尽管很安全，但弹射神奇格斯总觉得不妥。接下来画面会显得很混乱，但慢镜头将惊人地展示松鼠其实全程都掌控着局面。

原文: Alright, now here's a second angle.
翻译: 好的，现在换个角度再来一次。

原文: Also, even if you don't trust my calculations, I can assure you that the squirrels did not care. In both launch cases, they were back up on the course in like five minutes. Here's the slo mo and see if you can spot the two critical things he does to make sure he lands feet down.
翻译: 另外，就算你不相信我的计算结果，我也可以向你保证松鼠们根本不在乎。在两次发射中，它们都只用了五分钟就回到了赛道上。这是慢动作画面，看看你能否发现它为确保双脚着地所做的两个关键动作。

原文: Did you catch it? The first critical moment is right here. He's already done the predictive math and he's locked his head on the spot where he plans to land. And now his head will not lose that lock the whole way down.
翻译: 你注意到了吗？第一个关键时刻就在这里。他已经完成了预判计算，并将视线锁定在计划着陆的位置。从现在起，他的视线会全程保持锁定，直到落地。

原文: What's crazy is the time it takes him to do all the predictive math, to know exactly where he will land, and to lock his head is 300 milliseconds.
翻译: 疯狂的是，他完成所有预测计算、准确知道落点并锁定头部位置的时间仅为300毫秒。

原文: That's exactly this long. Literally less than the blink of an eye.
翻译: 就是这么长。简直比眨眼还快。

原文: That blows my mind. But if you think about it, it makes sense. These reactions would have evolved to be razor sharp. If you live your life in the trees constantly making split second decisions. Now, besides picking a landing spot with his head, the second trick is with his arm. When he wants to keep his upper body from rotating, he has his arms out. But the moment he wants to rotate his upper body quickly, he tucks them in. And then when he wants to stop rotating, he extends them out again. This is straight up conservation of angular momentum. It's the same trick ice skaters use.
翻译: 这简直让我难以置信。但仔细想想，确实合情合理。这些反应能力在进化过程中必然变得极其敏锐。如果你整天在树丛间生活，时刻都要做出瞬间判断。现在，除了用头部选择着陆点外，他的第二个诀窍在于手臂动作。当需要防止上半身旋转时，他会张开双臂。而当他需要快速转动上身时，就会立即收拢手臂。等到要停止旋转时，他又会再次伸展双臂。这完全就是角动量守恒原理的体现——和花样滑冰选手使用的技巧如出一辙。

原文: Basically bring your limbs in if you want to rotate fast, extend them out if you want to slow the rotation. My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day also made a video analyzing how cats always land on their feet and they do the exact same two tricks. The head target lock and bringing lens into rotate and out to stop rotation. Here's the second launch.
翻译: 基本上，想快速旋转就收拢四肢，想减速就伸展肢体。我朋友Destin的频道"每天更聪明"做过一期视频，分析猫为何总能四脚着地——它们用的正是这两招：头部锁定目标，收腿加速旋转，伸腿停止转动。现在进行第二次发射。

原文: So this may look like pure luck in real time, but the slow mo tells a different story. In that amount of time, he's already made a slight lateral push in that direction and locked his landing target with his head.
翻译: 这看起来像是实时的纯粹运气，但慢动作却揭示了不同的故事。在那短短的时间内，他已朝那个方向做了轻微的横向推动，并用头部锁定了着陆目标。

原文: We know from the previous clip he can rotate his body to any orientation, but he doesn't in this case because he sees his small push has already aligned him for the perfect landing. That's just so cool. And so, after those two physics demonstrations, I disabled both the launcher and the home wrecker trapdoor and just let them enjoy the course in peace. As far as I was concerned, they had earned it. Plus, after spending a month together, we were sort of bros. By this point. If they saw me coming out to work, they would certainly jump away. But then they'd just quickly be right back and sadly, all good things must come to an end. And because I didn't want them to develop an unhealthy dependence on my handouts, after about a week of free reign, I took down the core. But in its place, I put up a specialized squirrel sized picnic table. Every morning, this door opens to release just a few walnuts as a little treat to remind them of our good times together. Although I had to laugh that after all this, somehow I didn't anticipate.
翻译: 从之前的片段中我们知道，他能将身体旋转至任意角度，但这次他没有这样做，因为他发现轻轻一推已让自己完美对准了着陆点。这简直太酷了。完成这两个物理演示后，我关闭了发射器和破坏机关的活板门，让他们安心享受这个赛道。在我看来，这是他们应得的。更何况经过一个月的相处，到这时候我们已成了好哥们。虽然他们看到我出来干活时仍会跳开，但转眼又会立刻回来。可惜天下没有不散的筵席，我不希望他们过度依赖我的投喂，所以在放任一周后，我拆除了核心装置。不过在原处安放了一张松鼠尺寸的野餐桌——每天清晨，这扇小门会打开，放出几颗核桃作为小点心，让他们记得我们共度的美好时光。虽然最后这个结局，连我自己都没想到会如此有趣。

原文: On day one, Frank would immediately try and figure out and partially succeed in finding a way to beat the system. Like everything else though, they quickly caught on. And now on some mornings, I'll catch them just waiting for the daily ration, chilling patiently on the bench seat that is everyone but.
翻译: 第一天，弗兰克就立刻试图找出并部分成功地摸索出钻系统空子的方法。不过和往常一样，他们很快就察觉了。现在有些早晨，我会发现它们就那样等着每日配给，悠闲地趴在长椅上，和其他人截然不同。

原文: But fantastic, Gus. Don't ever change, buddy.
翻译: 太棒了，格斯。永远别改变，老兄。

原文: When I started this two month long adventure trying to bird watch, I had no idea I would enjoy squirrel watching so much more. It's also made me realize that even amongst the structures and pavement and power lines. How interesting nature can be in a single suburban backyard if you just really stop to look. Even the plants are amazing. I had no idea that as vines grow they spin around looking for something to grab onto. I didn't anticipate the wide variety of animals that use fences as inner yard highways to get around as a substitute for all the trees that existed before we got here.
翻译: 当我开始这段为期两个月的观鸟冒险时，完全没想到自己会更痴迷于观察松鼠。这段经历让我意识到，即便在钢筋水泥、柏油马路和电线杆之间，只要真正停下脚步观察，郊区后院里的自然世界竟能如此妙趣横生。就连植物都令人惊叹——我从未注意到藤蔓生长时会旋转着寻找攀附物。更没预料到会有这么多动物把篱笆当作庭院里的高速公路，替代人类到来前那些参天古木的功能。

原文: Even little interactions like this spider extending his life with this very timely leap into the unknown were just so delightful to see. But of all the animals, I can definitively say now that squirrels are my absolute favorite and they're certainly a more formidable adversary than porch pirates. They're kind of adorable, incredibly crafty, curious by nature, athletic and persistent. Turns out squirrels can live to be 20 years old, and so I like to think that someday Fantastic Gus will bring his grand squirrels to the fence and regale them with tales of cowboys and courage and legendary walnut piles.
翻译: 即使是像这只蜘蛛这样，以如此及时的纵身一跃进入未知来延长生命的小小互动，看着也让人无比愉悦。但在所有动物中，我现在可以笃定地说松鼠绝对是我的最爱，它们可比门廊盗贼难对付多了。它们有点可爱，极其狡猾，天生好奇，身手敏捷又锲而不舍。原来松鼠能活到20岁，所以我喜欢想象，终有一天神奇格斯会带着它的松鼠孙辈们来到栅栏边，给它们讲述牛仔、勇气和传奇核桃堆的故事。

原文: This is a bird feeder. And everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an eight part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
翻译: 这是一个喂鸟器。我左边这些装置都是为了防松鼠而设的。如果它们想吃鸟食，就得先通过这个专门为松鼠设计的八关忍者勇士障碍赛道。

原文: This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart, but out of the gate. I will admit that in hindsight that I completely underestimated my adversary. Now, if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a bird watcher. And it was just so lovely until they showed up.
翻译: 这门课程极具挑战性，绝非胆小之辈所能胜任。说实话，现在回想起来，我完全低估了这个对手。若你好奇我为何自找麻烦，得追溯到八周前——当时我困在家中百无聊赖，便装了喂鸟器想当观鸟者。原本岁月静好，直到它们出现。

原文: Now, luckily, my bird feeder had a wire cage around it. Big enough for the birds to slip inside, but small enough to prevent the squirrels from getting the food. And that worked really well until right here. For me, this was like the moment in Jurassic park when they realized the velociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn't their first rodeo. They basically cleared this whole tube of birdseed by the end of the day. Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised as being squirrel proof. So I bought another squirrel proof bird feeder to replace it. It's got this outer cage suspended by some springs. And so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn't weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes, it'll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no idea how the squirrels could possibly outsmart this, but let's see. And this one worked exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it. But when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts down. And now all the seed ports are covered up. Every time they tried, it was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springs that hold the cage up, which means the cage stays in the lowered position where it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now they can get to the lid. But this bird feeder lid doesn't hinge open to give direct access. So he goes with a different tactic where he now has access to all the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try one more bird feeder design.
翻译: 幸运的是，我的喂鸟器外围装有金属网笼。网眼大小刚好能让鸟儿钻入，又能阻止松鼠偷食。这招一直很管用——直到此刻。对我来说，这简直像《侏罗纪公园》里人们发现迅猛龙会转门把手的震撼场景。当这扇"门"被打开后，显然松鼠们早已轻车熟路。到天黑前，它们几乎清空了整管鸟食。要知道这个喂鸟器广告可是标榜"防松鼠"的。于是我又买了个号称防松鼠的新款，这次的设计是用弹簧悬挂外笼——当鸟儿停驻时，体重较轻仍可吃到种子；但若有松鼠攀附，其重量会压降弹簧笼，从而隔绝取食通道。我实在想不出松鼠还能怎么破解，且看吧。这个装置起初运行完美：鸟儿们欢快进食，而每当松鼠靠近，笼子便应声降落封住所有喂食口。屡试屡败后，次日清晨这家伙竟解开了固定弹簧的卡扣，导致防护笼持续处于低位封锁状态。但新问题来了：它们由此能接触到顶盖。不过顶盖并非铰链式直接开启结构，于是它换了策略——现在所有鸟食都任君采撷了。看来我得再换一种喂鸟器设计试试。

原文: Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one's supposed to work well because it's got this baffle which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight down and getting to the seeds.
翻译: 好吧。哇哦。这简直像是故意的。这款应该很管用，因为它带有一个挡板，能防止松鼠直接钻下来偷吃种子。

原文: And more importantly, there's no way for them to Rip this off. We'll see.
翻译: 更重要的是，他们绝不可能剽窃这个创意。走着瞧吧。

原文: This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes. This is when I really started to gain an appreciation for what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feeder was their favorite. Okay, yeah, they're flexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan was forming in my head. But just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can't say I was surprised when they just climbed it. Nor was I surprised to see they could shimmy up and down a small metal pole, or even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb a certain pole material was a moot point anyways. Because of this. Look at this. These guys are basically freaking rodent sized.
翻译: 这只松鼠初次亮相时表现如出一辙。当它仅用几根脚趾悬吊时，我才真正开始意识到它们的能耐。这个喂鸟器显然是它们的最爱。好吧，它们绝对是在向我炫耀。此时我脑海中已酝酿出一个计划。但为求严谨，我把立柱移离了围栏。当看到它们照样攀爬而上时，我丝毫不觉意外。它们能在细金属杆甚至粗杆上灵活攀援的景象，同样不足为奇。其实讨论它们能否攀爬某种材质的杆子已无意义——瞧瞧这个，这些家伙简直和啮齿动物一样袖珍。

原文: Simone Biles. And on some level, this is what it felt like when someone stole a package from my porch that didn't belong to them. And I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the glitter bomb bait package.
翻译: 西蒙·拜尔斯。某种程度上说，这就像有人从我门廊偷走不属于他们的包裹时我的感受。我利用这种愤慨，花了一年时间设计出这个闪光炸弹诱饵包裹。

原文: Hello. Complete with special fragrances. If I could design a package to deter thieves, could I design a bird feeder to deter squirrels?
翻译: 你好。配备特殊香气。如果我能设计一个防盗包装，那我能不能设计一个防松鼠的喂鸟器？

原文: And so, after a couple weeks of brainstorming, designing and building with my buddy John, we put it all together in this 22nd build montage.
翻译: 于是，在和我哥们儿约翰一起头脑风暴、设计加施工折腾了几周后，我们把这些成果浓缩进了第22期搭建集锦里。

原文: Here are the basic elements. For starters, here's where I've placed their favorite bird feeder at the end of the course.
翻译: 以下是基本布局：首先，我把他们最爱的喂鸟器放在了赛道尽头这个位置。

原文: And to sweeten the deal, right below that there's a trap door.
翻译: 为了让这买卖更划算，正下方还藏了个暗门。

原文: And if they step here, it releases a butt ton of walnuts and unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts?
翻译: 要是他们踩到这里，就会哗啦啦倒下一大堆核桃，还会展开几条庆祝横幅。为啥是核桃呢？

原文: I'm glad you asked. I'm using walnuts because over the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven different nuts and seeds.
翻译: 很高兴你问这个。我选用核桃是因为我用一周时间做了个实验，摆了七种不同的坚果和种子当自助餐。

原文: And all four times I repeated the experiment. Walnuts were always the one they ate first. What's great about placing this here is it levels the playing field as the birds can fly up and get as much food as they want anytime they need it. The squirrels, however, will have to work for it, because the only way to make it to this platform is if they work their way through my eight part ninja warrior obstacle course. Which all starts right here. This is the only platform on the course that has a pole that isn't covered and slippery stuff.
翻译: 我重复了四次实验，结果每次都是核桃最先被吃掉。把食物放在这里的妙处在于创造了公平竞争环境——鸟儿随时都能飞上来饱餐一顿。但松鼠就得费点功夫了，因为它们必须闯过我的八关忍者勇士障碍赛道才能抵达这个平台。起点就在这儿，这是赛道上唯一设有裸露防滑杆的站台。

原文: Which means this is where they have to climb up to enter the course.
翻译: 这意味着他们必须从这里攀爬上去才能进入赛道。

原文: If they try and get up any other way, they can't keep a good grip and they just slide back down. So the first challenge is the bridge of instability.
翻译: 如果它们试图用其他方式攀爬，就无法抓牢，只会滑落下去。所以第一道难关就是这座"不稳定之桥"。

原文: Now, this may look easy, but the trick is it attaches at A single point on each end. And from a physics standpoint, that makes it no different than trying to crawl across a tightrope. It's the same deceptive principle with that one carnival game that's so impossible, I broke it down in another video where I used physics to show which carnival games were basically scams and the science on how to beat them. Next up, the maze of a thousand corridors. This one's a bit more cerebral, but if they make it through that, it will bring them to the pitchfork tumblers, which are inspired by the show Wipeout.
翻译: 这看似简单，但关键在于它两端都只固定在一个支点上。从物理学角度来看，这跟走钢丝绳没什么区别。就像那个根本不可能赢的嘉年华游戏一样，都利用了欺骗性原理——我在另一期视频里用物理学原理拆穿过哪些嘉年华游戏本质是骗局，并讲解了通关的科学方法。接下来是千回百转的迷宫，这关更考验脑力。若能成功穿越，他们将面对三叉戟滚筒阵，这个装置的灵感来自闯关节目《Wipeout》。

原文: But unlike Wipeout, I should point out that all these contraptions are squirrel friendly, and even with a little back force, they will break away and stop spinning. Now, if they can make it past the pitchfork tumblers of treachery, they come to one of my personal favorites, the Homewrecker.
翻译: 但不同于《Wipeout》节目，我必须说明这些装置都对松鼠很友好，即便受到些许反向冲击力，它们也会自动脱离并停止旋转。现在，如果它们能闯过那阴险的干草叉滚筒阵，就会来到我最爱的关卡之一——"家庭破坏者"。

原文: I put her in to tempt the squirrel to lose focus on the real prize at the end of the course. Because this pad has a pressure sensor underneath it, and it connects to a microcontroller that has a relay that connects to a solenoid that connects to a pneumatic piston that connects back to this platform with the pressure sensor. And so if they stand here for more than three seconds, they've got to start the course all over again. Next up is the Slinky Bridge of Deception. I've suspended a juicy walnut right in the middle, but there's no way this bridge will support their weight, so it'll be interesting to see how they approach it. The sixth challenge is called the Tourist Trap. It's actually a bit of a reward for making it this far. If the squirrel sticks their head through this board my wife painted, it's just a photo op they can hang on the wall of their tiny squirrel nest. I'll place a walnut here as an incentive for them not to miss this unique opportunity. The penultimate challenge are the quad steps of Great elevation. This is taken straight from Ninja Warrior, and this is super tricky because these paths are all totally smoothed and placed at a 45 degree incline. And now for the last challenge. At this point, they are a mere few feet away from their ultimate goal. But if they're not careful, they'll have to deal with the orbital assist platform ak the final countdown, AKA it's not a catapult, it's a squirrel, a pult.
翻译: 我把她放进去是为了引诱松鼠在赛道终点对真正的奖品分心。因为这块垫子下面装有压力传感器，连接着带继电器的微控制器，继电器又连着电磁阀，电磁阀接着气动活塞，活塞最终又连回这个带压力传感器的平台。所以如果它们在这里停留超过三秒，就得从头开始闯关。接下来是"欺骗弹簧桥"。我在正中间挂了颗诱人的核桃，但这桥根本承受不住它们的体重，所以看它们如何应对会很有趣。第六关叫"游客陷阱"，算是给闯到这里的奖励。如果松鼠把头探进我妻子画的这块板，就能拍张照片挂到它们小松鼠窝的墙上。我会在这儿放颗核桃，确保它们不会错过这个独特机会。倒数第二关是"四重天阶"，直接借鉴了《忍者勇士》的设计，这些完全光滑的踏板呈45度倾斜，难度超高。现在来到终极挑战。此时它们距离最终目标仅几步之遥，但稍有不慎就会触发"轨道辅助平台"——又名"最终倒计时"——重申一遍这不是弹弓，是松鼠发射器。

原文: Which means they now have to go back and start all the way over from the beginning. Now, if they want to avoid that fate, they just need to stand on this pad for less than three seconds. But once again, I've placed a diversion here. This one projects an optical illusion of anything you place in the bottom of this dish. It's actually super trippy and looks even more impressive in real life because the projected image is 3D.
翻译: 这意味着他们现在必须从头再来一遍。如果想避免这种命运，他们只需在这个垫子上站立不到三秒。但这次我又设了个干扰装置——这个装置能把你放在盘底的任何东西投射成光学幻象。效果特别迷幻，实际看起来更震撼，因为投射的影像是3D立体的。

原文: They're like nine bucks on Amazon. And I put a link that explains the juicy physics of how they work in video description. Now, with regards to squirrel safety, I know I seem to have this reputation of improvised high speed projectiles, and so this one might worry a few animal lovers out there, including my wife. We have five pets and one child, and the child was the only one I had a say in. So rest assured, I can adjust the pressure on the piston, and we'll be staying way below any launch force that could hurt any of our adorable backyard contestants. And so, finally, after making it through all that, we're back here at the world's most satisfying bird feeder. And as far as I'm concerned, if they make it here, they've earned the right to gorge next to the birds for as long as they want. And so, after nearly a month of prep work, the course was officially open for business.
翻译: 亚马逊上卖九美元左右。我在视频描述里放了链接，详细解释它们运作的物理原理。至于松鼠安全问题，我知道我总给人留下即兴发射高速抛射物的印象，这次可能让一些动物爱好者担心了，包括我妻子。我家有五只宠物和一个孩子，其中只有孩子是我能作主的。所以请放心，我可以调节活塞压力，确保发射力度远低于可能伤害这些可爱后院选手的阈值。终于，在完成所有准备工作后，我们回到了这个世界上最解压的喂鸟器前。在我看来，能成功抵达这里的松鼠，完全有资格和鸟儿们一起尽情享用美食。经过近一个月的筹备，这个挑战赛道正式开业了。

原文: They could smell the walnuts at the final station, and you could see the gears turning because right above that was their favorite bird feeder.
翻译: 他们能在终点站闻到核桃的香气，你甚至能看到他们眼珠直转——因为正上方就是他们最爱的喂鸟器。

原文: And so, before long, we had our first contender that didn't exactly go as planned. So Rick decides to regroup. Speaking of which, that's Rick. There are a total of four competitors that will be attempting the course. First up is Rick, and he weighs five.
翻译: 没过多久，我们迎来了首位挑战者，但进展并不顺利。于是瑞克决定重整旗鼓。说到这个，那位就是瑞克。共有四位选手将尝试挑战这个赛道。打头阵的是体重五磅的瑞克。

原文: I know this because he's actually standing on a custom made scale. Rick is very clever, as you'll see here in a minute, but he also gets spooked easily.
翻译: 我知道这点是因为他正站在一个特制的秤上。Rick非常聪明，你马上就能见识到，但他也容易受惊吓。

原文: Next up is Marty. He's basically indistinguishable from Rick. Rick and Marty are inseparable and pretty much spend all their time together as a pair.
翻译: 接下来是马蒂。他和瑞克简直是一个模子刻出来的。瑞克和马蒂形影不离，几乎所有时间都成双成对地待在一起。

原文: Our third contender is Frank, also coming in around 500 grams.
翻译: 我们的第三位参赛者是弗兰克，重量也在500克左右。

原文: He's very gutsy. He's also kind of dumb. Finally, we've got my personal favorite, Fat Gus. He's just really charming and will strike a pose if he sees a camera. He also really likes to eat, and he tips the scales at an impressive 800 grams. While most of the squirrels are kind of particular. Before making a selection and then gracefully leaping away, Fat Gus just goes for it, hands free, just makes himself real comfortable. Here he is laying out with a light snack from the bird feeder. I mean, you can't fault the guy for just clearly appreciating a good meal. So now that you Know our four contenders.
翻译: 这家伙胆子贼大，但也挺二。最后登场的是我的最爱——胖格斯，它浑身散发着魅力，一见镜头就摆造型。这吃货体重惊人地达到了800克，别的松鼠都挑三拣四，非得精挑细选后才优雅跳走，可咱们胖格斯直接上手，怎么舒服怎么来。瞧它这副德行，正瘫在喂鸟器旁边享受小零食呢。说真的，人家就爱美食这口，你能说啥？好了，现在四位选手都介绍完了。

原文: Let's get back to Rick. So he hops back on, and he's actually doing better than his first attempt. Just barely.
翻译: 我们回到里克这边。他又骑了上去，这次表现确实比第一次尝试要好些。虽然也就好那么一点点。

原文: This is the best. Because he's like, okay, I got this.
翻译: 这简直太棒了。因为他那副"没问题，看我的"的样子。

原文: Never mind. Well, maybe I. No, I definitely don't.
翻译: 算了。呃，也许我...不，我肯定不。

原文: And this was the exact moment I realized I just might be outmatched here.
翻译: 就在这一刻，我意识到自己可能要栽了。

原文: Marty was watching Rick, and after a quick dip of his toes in the water, adopts his strategy right out of the gate. Oof. So close.
翻译: 马蒂观察着里克的策略，刚试探性地伸脚试水，就立刻照搬了他的战术。哎呀，就差那么一点。

原文: But an excellent recovery. And Fat Gus, perhaps predictably, comes up a little short. Which brings us to the maze of a thousand corridors, which, to be honest, they mastered this one pretty quickly.
翻译: 但恢复得相当出色。而胖格斯嘛，不出所料还是稍逊一筹。现在我们要面对的是千回百转的迷宫走廊——说实话，他们这次倒是很快就掌握了诀窍。

原文: Here's a solid run from Fat Gus.
翻译: 胖格斯这波操作稳得很。

原文: And now for the pitchfork tumblers of treachery. Marty was like, yeah, that's a hard pass. Fat Gus is just like, abort. Frank is just like, nope. Then he's like, wait a second. Mm. Still nope.
翻译: 现在轮到这些背信弃义的杂技演员了。马蒂直接表示："不了，没戏"。胖格斯干脆说："撤吧"。弗兰克一开始也说："不行"，但突然顿了顿，"嗯...还是不行"。

原文: Then Marty flies in real hot over the top. He did make it through, but that's partial credit as far as I'm concerned. And then here's Fat Gus with my favorite attempt by far.
翻译: 接着马蒂从上方高速俯冲而下。他确实成功通过了，但在我看来这只能算勉强及格。然后轮到胖格斯，目前为止他的尝试可是我最看好的。

原文: And then Frank shows no fear, which helps him pull off this near flawless run.
翻译: 随后弗兰克毫无惧色，这让他近乎完美地完成了这场表演。

原文: And finally, Smart Rick surgically weaves his way through essentially untouched.
翻译: 最终，机灵鬼瑞克毫发无损地穿行而过。

原文: And I should mention the squirrels were Most active from 6 to 10am so every morning I've been getting up before the sunrise to start filming from in my house. Like when of those camouflage nature photographers, only like a suburbanized version. I've also had a handful of streaming cameras rolling 24 7, which has allowed me to make such discoveries as we have the world's worst guard dog. Thanks for the help, pal.
翻译: 需要特别说明的是，松鼠们在早上6点到10点最为活跃，所以我每天天不亮就得起床，从家里开始拍摄。活像个伪装潜伏的野生动物摄影师，只不过是在郊区版本。我还架设了几台24小时不间断拍摄的监控摄像机，这才发现我们家养了全世界最不中用的看门狗。真是多谢帮忙啊，伙计。

原文: Now back to the homewrecker. You can see Rick is instinctively suspicious of this gold digger and only for a brief moment puts his full weight on the platform. I told you he was smart. His buddy Marty, on the other hand, she is a cruel mistress. And because I know my wife is going to ask me, no, this will not hurt the squirrel for two reasons. Number one, they are amazing like cats and always land on their feet. And two, they themselves were jumping from this height all the time. And in some cases, much higher. In fact, squirrels are one of the few mammals that can survive a fall from any height because they make their terminal velocity so low. You can see it right here. They make their body as flat as possible, then put their tail back to increase drag. They basically become their own parachute. And then right before they land, they pull in and fully extend their arms and legs to act as shock absorbing landing gear. This is so cool. Now back to the course where even Smart Rick eventually lets his guard down, which is exactly when she strikes. But just like all the other obstacles so far, after a day or two they'd mastered it. In this case even disregarding her offering of a fresh walnut. Now onto the Slinky bridge of deception. And this was the sleeper obstacle. In my book, that is not a large gap which they can easily jump, but having the Slinky there just threw them off somehow. You can see how much Frank is struggling here and he's the brave one. And Rick only jumps when Marty shows up for emotional support.
翻译: 现在回到这个破坏家庭的小妖精身上。可以看到瑞克本能地对这个拜金女充满戒心，只在平台上短暂地全身心放松过。我说过他很聪明吧。而他的伙伴马蒂就惨了，这装置是个残忍的 mistress（女主人）。我知道妻子肯定会问我——放心，这不会伤害松鼠，原因有二：其一，它们像猫一样总能四脚着地；其二，它们自己就经常从这种高度跳下，有时甚至更高。事实上，松鼠是少数能从任意高度坠落存活的哺乳动物，因为它们能把终端速度降到极低。看这里——它们尽量摊平身体，后摆尾巴增加阻力，简直自带降落伞。快着陆时又蜷缩身体，完全伸展四肢作为缓冲装置。太酷了！回到挑战场地，连聪明的瑞克最终也放松警惕，就在这时机关发动了。但和前几关一样，一两天后它们就掌握了诀窍，这次甚至无视了新鲜核桃的诱惑。现在来到欺骗性的弹簧桥，这才是隐藏杀手锏。在我看来那道缝隙它们轻松就能跳过，但弹簧的存在莫名干扰了判断。看看勇敢的弗兰克有多挣扎吧，而瑞克只有在马蒂赶来精神支持时才敢起跳。

原文: But like all the obstacles so far, after a day or two, they'd mastered it. Now onto our third to last obstacle, the tourist trap.
翻译: 但就像之前的所有障碍一样，一两天后他们便成功攻克。现在来到倒数第三关——游客陷阱。

原文: And this one was just a freaking delight. A little peanut butter really did the trick here.
翻译: 这款简直绝了，加点花生酱立马就对了味儿。

原文: Now here comes Fat Gus and I mean, how Fat Gus is this?
翻译: 胖格斯来了，我是说，这也太胖格斯了吧？

原文: He sees the camera and he's like, paint me like one of your French squirrels.
翻译: 他一看到镜头就摆出姿势说："把我画成你笔下的法国松鼠吧。"

原文: Yeah. No, no takers. Alright, here's another classic Gus, where he looks at the camera.
翻译: 好嘞。没人接茬是吧？行，再来个格斯经典款——他直勾勾盯着镜头的那个。

原文: Wait a second. Play that back.
翻译: 等一下。倒回去重放。

原文: And freeze, zoom, enhance.
翻译: 定格，放大，增强。

原文: Well, turns out Fat Gus is not a dude and he's pregnant. Which meant I was suddenly feeling real uncomfortable about all those weight comments. So after a bit of a pivot to smooth things over, we soldiered on to the quad steps of great elevation.
翻译: 原来胖格斯不是公的，还怀了孕。这下我突然觉得之前那些关于体重的玩笑话特别不合适。于是我们赶紧转移话题缓和气氛，然后继续向海拔极高的四方阶梯进发。

原文: Frank comes in rather confident, almost his demise, but he pulls off the smooth recovery.
翻译: 弗兰克进来时信心满满，差点栽了跟头，但他还是巧妙地圆了回来。

原文: So after not much time at all, they were looking pretty good here. In fact, one morning I noticed Marty totally skipped the last step altogether, which I took as a challenge. And so I removed the middle step to see what they would do. And who else but Fantastic Gus?
翻译: 没过多久，它们在这里就适应得很好了。实际上有天早上，我发现马蒂直接跳过了最后一级台阶，这激起了我的好胜心。于是我把中间的台阶也拆掉，想看看它们会怎么做。果然不出所料——了不起的格斯又来了！

原文: Let's slow that down a bit. They're such amazing jumpers, so I suppose the quick mastery here wasn't a surprise. I mean, this right here is probably a ten foot jump. And here's some classic brave but dumb Frank. He'd already entered the course normally and made it to the home wrecker at least a dozen times by this point. And yet for some reason he decides his 12 foot jump is his best course of action.
翻译: 我们放慢点看。它们跳跃能力惊人，所以这么快掌握技巧也不意外。看这个跳跃得有3米远。现在出场的是经典"勇猛但缺根筋"的弗兰克——它明明已经正常通过赛道，至少十几次成功闯到"拆家神器"这关了。可不知为啥，它突然觉得4米跳远才是最佳选择。

原文: Smartrick was the first one to enter the course. So in the end, after about a week of effort, it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first. And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse. In hindsight, we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter. Here's Marty, as always, not far behind he's also a bit flighty, as you know, which worked against him here, because down below, Fantastic Gus, ever the opportunist, comes through with a real stroke of brilliance. But pretty soon, Marty comes back like, um, I'm the one who kind of earned that. And then Fantastic Gus is like, you snooze, you lose, sucker. And might I just say, Fantastic Gus, when you sit like that, you don't look an ounce over 700 grams. Eventually, they learned that sound was a good thing, and they'd quickly return for their reward before Fantastic Gus got any ideas. So here's a single camera shot of a full run, and by the end, all of them could do the full course in less than 40 seconds. And while we're watching, you might be wondering what happened to the squirrel a put. Unfortunately, they didn't really fall for my illusion much. But I'm about to show you the two times they did. And as a promise to my wife, I turned the pressure to only 40% full power. So the acceleration the squirrel would feel is about half a g, which is 10 times less than a typical roller coaster. Additionally, I never turned on either the Homewrecker trapdoor or the launch platform when I wasn't actively watching from inside my house, where I had a manual override button. Because as safe as it was, something about launching fantastic gusts just didn't feel right. Now what you're about to see is gonna look pretty chaotic, but when we check the slow mo, amazingly, I'll show you how the squirrel is totally in control pretty much the whole time.
翻译: Smartrick是第一个进入赛道的。所以经过一周的努力后，由他最先抵达大奖位置再合适不过了。他兴奋得甚至想倒着跑完全程——现在想想，或许该把大奖机关做得安静些。老熟人Marty紧随其后，不过你也知道这家伙有点毛躁，这让他吃了亏。此时下方的Fantastic Gus抓住机会，来了个绝妙操作。但很快Marty就杀了回来，摆出"这功劳该归我"的架势。Fantastic Gus则回敬道："手快有手慢无，菜鸟"。顺便说句，Fantastic Gus你那个坐姿看起来绝对不超过700克重。后来它们发现声响意味着好事，就会赶在Fantastic Gus动歪脑筋前火速领奖。这是全程的单镜头记录，最后它们都能在40秒内跑完全程。观赛时你或许会好奇那只松鼠去哪了？可惜它们基本没中我的幻术陷阱。不过接下来你会看到两次成功案例。向妻子保证过，我只把气压调到40%功率，松鼠承受的加速度约0.5个g，是普通过山车的十分之一。而且只要我没在屋里盯着（那里有紧急停止按钮），就绝不会启动"家庭破坏者"活板门或弹射台——虽说安全有保障，但弹射Fantastic Gus总觉得不太对劲。接下来画面会显得很混乱，但慢镜头将惊人地展示松鼠其实全程都掌控着局面。

原文: Alright, now here's a second angle.
翻译: 好的，现在换个角度再看一下。

原文: Also, even if you don't trust my calculations, I can assure you that the squirrels did not care. In both launch cases, they were back up on the course in like five minutes. Here's the slo mo and see if you can spot the two critical things he does to make sure he lands feet down.
翻译: 另外，就算你不相信我的计算结果，我也可以向你保证松鼠们根本不在乎。在两次发射过程中，它们都只用了五分钟就重新回到跑道上。这是慢动作画面，看看你能否发现它为确保四脚着地所做的两个关键动作。

原文: Did you catch it? The first critical moment is right here. He's already done the predictive math and he's locked his head on the spot where he plans to land. And now his head will not lose that lock the whole way down.
翻译: 你注意到了吗？第一个关键时刻就在这儿。他已经完成了预判计算，将视线锁定在计划着陆的位置。现在，他的视线会在下落过程中始终保持这个锁定状态。

原文: What's crazy is the time it takes him to do all the predictive math, to know exactly where he will land, and to lock his head is 300 milliseconds.
翻译: 令人难以置信的是，他完成所有预测性计算、精准判断落点位置并锁定头部朝向的全过程仅需300毫秒。

原文: That's exactly this long. Literally less than the blink of an eye.
翻译: 就是这么长。真的比一眨眼还短。

原文: That blows my mind. But if you think about it, it makes sense. These reactions would have evolved to be razor sharp. If you live your life in the trees constantly making split second decisions. Now, besides picking a landing spot with his head, the second trick is with his arm. When he wants to keep his upper body from rotating, he has his arms out. But the moment he wants to rotate his upper body quickly, he tucks them in. And then when he wants to stop rotating, he extends them out again. This is straight up conservation of angular momentum. It's the same trick ice skaters use.
翻译: 这简直让我震惊。但细想之下又合情合理——这些反应能力必然进化得极其敏锐，毕竟它们常年生活在树上，需要不断做出瞬间判断。除了用头部选择落点外，他的第二个诀窍在于手臂运用：当需要稳定上半身时就将双臂展开；想要快速转身时立刻收拢手臂；需要停止旋转时再次伸展。这完全就是角动量守恒原理的应用，和花样滑冰选手使用的技巧如出一辙。

原文: Basically bring your limbs in if you want to rotate fast, extend them out if you want to slow the rotation. My buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day also made a video analyzing how cats always land on their feet and they do the exact same two tricks. The head target lock and bringing lens into rotate and out to stop rotation. Here's the second launch.
翻译: 基本上，想要快速旋转就把四肢收拢，想减速就把四肢展开。我的好友Destin来自"Smarter Every Day"频道，他也做过视频分析猫为何总能四脚着地——它们用的正是这两招：头部锁定目标，同时收拢四肢加速旋转，伸展四肢停止转动。现在来看第二次发射。

原文: So this may look like pure luck in real time, but the slow mo tells a different story. In that amount of time, he's already made a slight lateral push in that direction and locked his landing target with his head.
翻译: 这一幕在实时画面中看似纯属运气，但慢动作却揭示了不同的真相。就在这短短瞬间，他已朝那个方向微微侧身发力，并用头部锁定了着陆目标。

原文: We know from the previous clip he can rotate his body to any orientation, but he doesn't in this case because he sees his small push has already aligned him for the perfect landing. That's just so cool. And so, after those two physics demonstrations, I disabled both the launcher and the home wrecker trapdoor and just let them enjoy the course in peace. As far as I was concerned, they had earned it. Plus, after spending a month together, we were sort of bros. By this point. If they saw me coming out to work, they would certainly jump away. But then they'd just quickly be right back and sadly, all good things must come to an end. And because I didn't want them to develop an unhealthy dependence on my handouts, after about a week of free reign, I took down the core. But in its place, I put up a specialized squirrel sized picnic table. Every morning, this door opens to release just a few walnuts as a little treat to remind them of our good times together. Although I had to laugh that after all this, somehow I didn't anticipate.
翻译: 从之前的片段我们知道，他能将身体旋转至任意角度，但这次他没有这样做，因为他发现轻轻一推就已调整到完美着陆姿态。这简直太酷了。完成这两个物理演示后，我关闭了发射器和破坏机关的活板门，让他们安心享受这个场地。在我看来，这是他们应得的。更何况经过一个月的相处，到这时候我们简直成了哥们。虽然他们看到我出来干活时还是会跳开，但转眼就会跑回来。可惜天下没有不散的筵席，为了避免他们过度依赖我的投喂，在让他们自由活动约一周后，我拆除了核心装置。不过我在原处安装了一张松鼠尺寸的野餐桌——每天清晨这扇小门会打开，放出几颗核桃作为小点心，让他们记得我们共度的美好时光。虽然最后这个结局，连我自己都忍俊不禁。

原文: On day one, Frank would immediately try and figure out and partially succeed in finding a way to beat the system. Like everything else though, they quickly caught on. And now on some mornings, I'll catch them just waiting for the daily ration, chilling patiently on the bench seat that is everyone but.
翻译: 第一天，弗兰克就会立刻试图找出并部分成功地发现钻系统空子的方法。不过和其他事情一样，他们很快就察觉了。现在有些早晨，我会看到它们就那样等着每日配给，悠闲耐心地坐在长椅上——而其他所有猫可不会这样。

原文: But fantastic, Gus. Don't ever change, buddy.
翻译: 但太棒了，格斯。永远保持这样，伙计。

原文: When I started this two month long adventure trying to bird watch, I had no idea I would enjoy squirrel watching so much more. It's also made me realize that even amongst the structures and pavement and power lines. How interesting nature can be in a single suburban backyard if you just really stop to look. Even the plants are amazing. I had no idea that as vines grow they spin around looking for something to grab onto. I didn't anticipate the wide variety of animals that use fences as inner yard highways to get around as a substitute for all the trees that existed before we got here.
翻译: 当我开始这段为期两个月的观鸟冒险时，完全没想到自己会更痴迷于观察松鼠。这段经历也让我意识到，即使在钢筋水泥、柏油马路和电线杆之间，只要真正停下脚步观察，郊区后院里的自然生态竟能如此妙趣横生。就连植物都令人惊叹——我从未注意到藤蔓生长时会旋转着寻找攀附物。更没预料到会有这么多动物把栅栏当作庭院里的"高速公路"，替代人类到来之前那些参天古树的功能。

原文: Even little interactions like this spider extending his life with this very timely leap into the unknown were just so delightful to see. But of all the animals, I can definitively say now that squirrels are my absolute favorite and they're certainly a more formidable adversary than porch pirates. They're kind of adorable, incredibly crafty, curious by nature, athletic and persistent. Turns out squirrels can live to be 20 years old, and so I like to think that someday Fantastic Gus will bring his grand squirrels to the fence and regale them with tales of cowboys and courage and legendary walnut piles.
翻译: 就连这样的小互动也令人愉悦——比如这只蜘蛛及时纵身跃入未知，从而延长了自己的生命。但在所有动物中，我现在可以笃定地说松鼠才是我的最爱，它们可比门廊盗贼难对付多了。这些小家伙既可爱又狡黠，天生好奇，身手矫健且锲而不舍。原来松鼠能活到20岁，所以我总幻想着某天"神奇格斯"会带着它的松鼠孙辈们来到栅栏上，给它们讲述关于牛仔、勇气和传奇核桃山的故事。

原文: This is a bird feeder. And everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an eight part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
翻译: 这是个喂鸟器。我左边这些装置都是为了防松鼠设计的。它们若想偷吃鸟食，就得先通过这座专为松鼠打造的八关忍者障碍赛场。

原文: This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart, but out of the gate. I will admit that in hindsight that I completely underestimated my adversary. Now, if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a bird watcher. And it was just so lovely until they showed up.
翻译: 这门课程极具挑战性，不适合胆小之人。说实话，事后回想起来，我完全低估了这个对手。如果你好奇我为何自找麻烦，那得回到八周前——当时我困在家中百无聊赖，便装了喂鸟器想当观鸟者。本来岁月静好，直到它们出现。

原文: Now, luckily, my bird feeder had a wire cage around it. Big enough for the birds to slip inside, but small enough to prevent the squirrels from getting the food. And that worked really well until right here. For me, this was like the moment in Jurassic park when they realized the velociraptors can open door handles. And once the door was open, it was clear this wasn't their first rodeo. They basically cleared this whole tube of birdseed by the end of the day. Mind you, this bird feeder was advertised as being squirrel proof. So I bought another squirrel proof bird feeder to replace it. It's got this outer cage suspended by some springs. And so if a bird comes and lands here, it doesn't weigh that much and it has access to the seeds. However, if a squirrel comes, it'll grab onto this cage. Its weight will force the springs down, thereby preventing access to the seeds. I have no idea how the squirrels could possibly outsmart this, but let's see. And this one worked exactly as intended. You can see the birds love it. But when the squirrel comes along, the cage shifts down. And now all the seed ports are covered up. Every time they tried, it was the same results. However, the next morning, this guy manages to unclip the springs that hold the cage up, which means the cage stays in the lowered position where it blocks all the seed openings. Problem with that is now they can get to the lid. But this bird feeder lid doesn't hinge open to give direct access. So he goes with a different tactic where he now has access to all the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try one more bird feeder design.
翻译: 幸运的是，我的喂鸟器外围装有金属网罩。开口大小刚好能让鸟儿钻入，又能阻止松鼠偷食。这套装置一直很管用——直到此刻。对我来说，这简直像《侏罗纪公园》里发现迅猛龙会开门的经典场面。而且看这娴熟手法，显然不是它们第一次作案。到傍晚时分，整管鸟食被洗劫一空。要知道这个喂鸟器广告可是标榜"防松鼠"的。

于是我换了另一个号称防松鼠的新款。这款采用弹簧悬挂外罩的设计：鸟儿体重轻，停驻时能正常取食；但松鼠一攀附，重量就会压降外罩挡住投食口。我实在想不出松鼠还能怎么破解，但...让我们拭目以待。

起初效果确实完美：鸟儿们享用自如，而松鼠一靠近外罩就自动下沉封住所有食槽。每次尝试都是同样结果。然而第二天清晨，这家伙居然解开了固定弹簧的卡扣，导致外罩持续处于下沉状态。虽然食槽被挡住，但它们因此能接触到顶盖——不过顶盖并非铰链式直接开启结构。

于是它换了新策略：通过顶盖缝隙大快朵颐。看来我只能再尝试第三种喂鸟器设计了。

原文: Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one's supposed to work well because it's got this baffle which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight down and getting to the seeds.
翻译: 好吧。哇，这简直像是故意的。这款应该很管用，因为它有个挡板，能防止松鼠直接下来偷吃种子。

原文: And more importantly, there's no way for them to Rip this off. We'll see.
翻译: 更重要的是，他们绝对没法山寨。走着瞧吧。

原文: This one debuted to similar results. As he hangs by a few toes. This is when I really started to gain an appreciation for what they were capable of. It definitely seemed like this bird feeder was their favorite. Okay, yeah, they're flexing on me for sure. And at this point, a plan was forming in my head. But just to be thorough, I moved the post away from the fence. And I can't say I was surprised when they just climbed it. Nor was I surprised to see they could shimmy up and down a small metal pole, or even a large one for that matter. And whether they could climb a certain pole material was a moot point anyways. Because of this. Look at this. These guys are basically freaking rodent sized.
翻译: 这个装置初次亮相时效果相似。只见它仅凭几根脚趾悬吊着。这时我才真正开始意识到它们的能耐。这个喂鸟器显然是它们的最爱。好吧，它们绝对是在向我炫耀。此刻我脑海中已酝酿出一个计划。但为求严谨，我还是把立柱移离了围栏。当看到它们照样攀爬而上时，我毫不意外。它们能在细金属杆上自如攀援，甚至粗杆也不在话下——这同样没让我吃惊。其实讨论能否攀爬某种材质的立柱已无意义。因为你看，这些家伙简直和啮齿动物一样灵巧。

原文: Simone Biles. And on some level, this is what it felt like when someone stole a package from my porch that didn't belong to them. And I harnessed that indignation, spending a year designing the glitter bomb bait package.
翻译: 西蒙·拜尔斯。某种程度上说，这就像有人从我门廊偷走不属于他们的包裹时我的感受。我利用这种愤慨，花了一年时间设计出这个闪光弹诱饵包裹。

原文: Hello. Complete with special fragrances. If I could design a package to deter thieves, could I design a bird feeder to deter squirrels?
翻译: 你好。附带特殊香气。如果我能设计防贼包装，那能不能设计出防松鼠的喂鸟器？

原文: And so, after a couple weeks of brainstorming, designing and building with my buddy John, we put it all together in this 22nd build montage.
翻译: 经过几周的头脑风暴、设计和与我哥们约翰一起搭建，我们最终在这个第22次搭建集锦中完成了全部工作。

原文: Here are the basic elements. For starters, here's where I've placed their favorite bird feeder at the end of the course.
翻译: 以下是基本布局。首先，我把他们最爱的喂鸟器放在了赛道尽头。

原文: And to sweeten the deal, right below that there's a trap door.
翻译: 为了锦上添花，正下方还藏了个暗门。

原文: And if they step here, it releases a butt ton of walnuts and unfurls some celebratory banners. Why walnuts?
翻译: 要是他们踩到这里，就会触发机关倒下一大堆核桃，还会展开庆祝横幅。为啥是核桃啊？

原文: I'm glad you asked. I'm using walnuts because over the course of a week, I put out a buffet of seven different nuts and seeds.
翻译: 很高兴你问这个。我选用核桃是因为我做过一周实验，摆出七种坚果种子的自助餐供选择。

原文: This is a bird feeder. And everything to my left is my attempt at making it squirrel proof. If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an eight part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
翻译: 这是个喂鸟器。左边这些全是我防松鼠的杰作。想偷吃鸟食？它们得先闯过这专为松鼠设计的八关忍者障碍赛。

原文: This course is extremely challenging. It is not for the timid of heart, but out of the gate. I will admit that in hindsight that I completely underestimated my adversary. Now, if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back eight weeks ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored. So I installed a bird feeder and decided to become a bird watcher. And it was just so lovely until they showed up.
翻译: 这门课程极具挑战性，绝非胆小之辈所能胜任。说实话，事后回想起来，我完全低估了这个对手。如果你好奇我为何自找苦吃，那得回到八周前——当时我困在家中百无聊赖，便装了喂鸟器想当观鸟人。本来岁月静好，直到它们出现。

Problem with that is now they can get to the lid. But this bird feeder lid doesn't hinge open to give direct access. So he goes with a different tactic where he now has access to all the bird seed he wants. And so I decided I would try one more bird feeder design.
翻译: 幸运的是我的喂鸟器外围装了铁丝网。网眼大小刚好能让鸟儿钻入，又能阻止松鼠偷食。这招一直很管用——直到此刻。对我来说，这就像《侏罗纪公园》里人们发现迅猛龙会开门把手的震撼场面。一旦大门敞开，显然它们已是惯犯。到天黑前，它们几乎清空了整管鸟食。要知道这个喂鸟器广告可是标榜"防松鼠"的。

于是我换了另一个号称防松鼠的新款。它的外笼由弹簧悬挂，鸟儿停驻时重量轻，仍能吃到种子。但若松鼠攀附，体重会压降弹簧，从而封住取食口。我实在想不出松鼠还能怎么破解，但让我们拭目以待。

这款起初表现完美：鸟儿们欢快进食，而松鼠一来笼子就下沉，所有喂食口立即封闭。每次尝试都是同样结果。然而次日清晨，这家伙竟解开了固定笼子的弹簧扣，导致笼子持续处于下沉状态。问题是现在它们能够到顶盖了——虽然顶盖并非铰链式设计无法直接掀开。于是它改用新策略，最终如愿以偿吃光了所有鸟食。看来我得再尝试第三种设计了。

原文: Okay. Wow. It almost feels intentional at this point. This one's supposed to work well because it's got this baffle which is supposed to keep the squirrels from just coming straight down and getting to the seeds.
翻译: 好吧，这也太巧了，简直像故意的。这款应该好用，它有个挡板，能防止松鼠直接下来偷吃种子。

原文: And more importantly, there's no way for them to Rip this off. We'll see.
翻译: 更重要的是，他们绝对没法山寨这个。走着瞧吧。
